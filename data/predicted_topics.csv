adrenal cortex,GSE205272,37129912,β-catenin programs a tissue-specific epigenetic vulnerability in aggressive adrenocortical carcinoma (DNA methylation array),"Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is a rare cancer in which tissue-specific differentiation is paradoxically associated with dismal outcomes. The differentiated ACC subtype CIMP-high is prevalent, incurable, and routinely fatal. CIMP-high ACC possess abnormal DNA methylation and frequent β-catenin activating mutations. Here, we demonstrate that this differentiated state is maintained by a balance between nuclear, tissue-specific β-catenin-containing complexes and the ACC epigenome. On chromatin, β-catenin binds master adrenal transcription factor SF1 and hijacks the adrenocortical super-enhancer landscape to maintain differentiation. Off chromatin, β-catenin binds histone methyltransferase EZH2, which is redistributed by the CIMP-high DNA methylation signature. SF1/β-catenin and EZH2/β-catenin complexes exist in normal adrenals and are selected for through all phases of ACC evolution. EZH2 inhibition in CIMP-high ACC favors EZH2/β-catenin assembly and purges SF1/β-catenin from chromatin, erasing differentiation and restraining cancer growth in vitro and in vivo.

This male-specific phenotype is associated with androgen-dependent induction of senescence, recruitment and differentiation of highly phagocytic macrophages that clear-out senescent cells.

adrenal cortex,GSE179308,35603952,Identification of new TCF21 targets in adrenocortical carcinoma cells,"Transcription factor 21 (TCF21) directly binds and regulates SF1 in tumor and normal adrenocortical cells, and both are involved in the development and steroidogenesis of the adrenal cortex. TCF21 is a tumor suppressor gene and its expression is reduced in malignant tumors. In adrenocortical tumors, it is less expressed in adrenocortical carcinomas (ACC) than in adrenocortical adenomas (ACA) and normal tissue. However, a comprehensive analysis to identify TCF21 targets have not yet been conducted in any type of cancer. In this study, we performed Chromatin Immunoprecipitation and Sequencing (ChIP-Seq) in adrenocortical carcinoma cell line (NCI-H295R) overexpressing TCF21, with the aim of identifying TCF21 new targets. The five most frequently identified sequences corresponded to the PRDM7, CNTNAP2, CACNA1B, PTPRN2 and KCNE1B genes. Validation experiments showed that, in NCI-H295R cells, TCF21 regulates gene expression positively in PRDM7 and negatively in CACNA1B. Recently, it was observed that the N-type calcium channel v2.2 (Cav2.2) encoded by CACNA1B gene is important in Angiotensin II signal transduction for corticosteroid biosynthesis in NCI-H295R adrenocortical carcinoma cells. Indeed, TCF21 inhibits CACNA1B and Cav2.2 expression in NCI-H295R. In addition, in a cohort of 55 adult patients with adrenocortical tumor, CACNA1B expression was higher in ACC than ACA, and was related to poor disease-free survival in ACC patients. These results suggest a mechanism of steroidogenesis control by TCF21 in adrenocortical tumor cells, in addition to the control observed through SF1 inhibition. Importantly, steroid production could impair tumor immunogenicity, contributing to the immune resistance described in adrenal cancer.","Fragmented DNA without immunoprecipitation was used as a positive control, and two replicates of NCI-H295R pCMVMycPOD1 cells were sequenced.

We asked whether tumors from patients with advanced or metastatic ACC would offer clues as to putative genes that might have critical roles in disease progression or in more aggressive disease biology.   Methods: We conducted comprehensive genomic and expression analyses, including microRNA profiling, of 33 ACCs and 6 normal adrenals.  Results: Copy number gains and losses matched that previously reported. We identified a median mutation rate of 3.38 per megabase (Mb), somewhat higher than in a previous study possibly related to the more advanced disease. The mutational signature was characterized by a predominance of C>T, C>A and T>C transitions. As in previously reports, only cancer genes TP53 (26%) and beta-catenin (CTNNB1, 14%) were mutated in more than 10% of samples. The TCGA-identified putative cancer genes MEN1 and PRKAR1A were found in low frequency – 4.7% and 2.3%, respectively. Most of the mutations were in genes not implicated in the etiology or maintenance of cancer. Specifically, amongst the 38 genes that were mutated in more than 9% of samples, only four were represented in Tier 1 of the 576 COSMIC Cancer Gene Census (CCGC). Thus, 82% of genes found to have mutations likely have no role in the etiology or biology of ACC; while the role of the other 18%, if any, remains to be proven. Finally, the transcript length for the 38 most frequently mutated genes in ACC is statistically longer than the average of all coding genes, raising the question of whether transcript length in part determined mutation probability.   Conclusions: We conclude that the mutational and expression profiles of advanced and metastatic tumors is very similar to those from newly diagnosed patients –with very little in the way of genomic aberration to explain it. Our data and that in the previous analyses finds the rate of mutations in ACCs lower than that in other cancers and suggests an epigenetic basis for the disease should be the focus of future studies.","Tumor samples embedded in OCT were sectioned, stained with hematoxylin and eosin and reviewed by a pathologist.

Mutations in different genes increase aldosterone production in PA, but additional mechanisms may contribute to increased cell proliferation and aldosterone producing adenoma (APA) development. We performed transcriptome analysis in APA and identified retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARα) signaling as a central molecular network involved in nodule formation. To understand how RARα modulates adrenal structure and function, we explored the adrenal phenotype of male and female Rarα knockout mice. Inactivation of Rarα in mice led to major structural disorganization of the adrenal cortex in both sexes, with increased adrenal cortex size in female mice and increased cell proliferation in males. Abnormalities of vessel architecture and extracellular matrix were due to decreased Vegfa expression and modifications in extracellular matrix components. On the molecular level, Rarα inactivation leads to inhibition of non-canonical Wnt signaling, without affecting the canonical Wnt pathway nor PKA signaling.

adrenal cortex,GSE124531,31522749,Long non-coding RNA expression profiling reveals LINC00271 as a prognostic marker in adrenocortical carcinoma,"Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is an aggressive malignancy with a low but variable overall survival rate. Even after complete tumor resection, over half of patients develop recurrent disease. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been found to be involved in cancer initiation/progression and as markers of cancer prognosis. The role of lncRNAs in ACC is poorly understood. Thus, in this study we performed lncRNA expression profiling in ACC, adrenocortical adenoma (ACA) and normal adrenal cortex (NAC).  Total RNA was extracted from fresh frozen tissue samples (11 ACA, nine ACC and five NAC samples) with histopathological confirmed diagnosis. ArrayStar Human LncRNA/mRNA Expression Microarray V3.0 was used for transcriptome analysis. Differentially expressed lncRNAs were validated using TaqMan real-time quantitative PCR in a validation cohort including an additional 10 ACCs. The ACC dataset from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project was used to evaluate the prognostic utility of lncRNAs found to be differentially expressed in ACC. Survival curves were plotted by Kaplan-Meier analysis, and differences in survival rates were assessed using a log-rank test. P < 0.05 was considered significant. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was performed to identify lncRNA-associated biological signaling pathways.  Unsupervised hierarchical and heat map clustering showed distinct clustering of ACC samples compared with NAC and ACA samples by lncRNA expression profiles. A total of 874 lncRNAs were differentially expressed between ACC and NAC, including known carcinogenesis-related lncRNAs such as HOTTIP, HOXA11-AS1, CRNDE, LINC00271 and TBXAS1. One thousand seventy-six lncRNAs were differentially expressed between ACC and ACA.

Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is an aggressive malignancy with a low but variable overall survival rate. Even after complete tumor resection, over half of patients develop recurrent disease. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been found to be involved in cancer initiation/progression and as markers of cancer prognosis. The role of lncRNAs in ACC is poorly understood. Thus, in this study we performed lncRNA expression profiling in ACC, adrenocortical adenoma (ACA) and normal adrenal cortex (NAC).  Total RNA was extracted from fresh frozen tissue samples (11 ACA, nine ACC and five NAC samples) with histopathological confirmed diagnosis. ArrayStar Human LncRNA/mRNA Expression Microarray V3.0 was used for transcriptome analysis. Differentially expressed lncRNAs were validated using TaqMan real-time quantitative PCR in a validation cohort including an additional 10 ACCs. The ACC dataset from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project was used to evaluate the prognostic utility of lncRNAs found to be differentially expressed in ACC. Survival curves were plotted by Kaplan-Meier analysis, and differences in survival rates were assessed using a log-rank test. P < 0.05 was considered significant. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was performed to identify lncRNA-associated biological signaling pathways.  Unsupervised hierarchical and heat map clustering showed distinct clustering of ACC samples compared with NAC and ACA samples by lncRNA expression profiles. A total of 874 lncRNAs were differentially expressed between ACC and NAC, including known carcinogenesis-related lncRNAs such as HOTTIP, HOXA11-AS1, CRNDE, LINC00271 and TBXAS1. One thousand seventy-six lncRNAs were differentially expressed between ACC and ACA. LINC00271 was a prognostic marker, with patients with low LINC00271 expression surviving significantly shorter than patients with a high LINC00271 expression. Median survival time (MST) for the low-expression group was 1788 days, whereas the MST was not reached for the high-expression group (P < 0.019).

The Weiss score is the current most widely used system for ACT diagnosis but it has limitations, particularly with ACTs with a score of 3.  The am of this study was to identify molecular markers whose expression can discriminate adrenocortical carcinomas (ACCs) from adrenocortical adenomas (ACAs) by microarray gene expression profiling and to determine their clinical applicability by using immunohistochemistry (IHC).  Experimental design: Microarray gene expression profiling was used to identify 7 molecular markers which were significantly differentially expressed between ACCs and ACAs.  These results were confirmed with quantitative PCR for all 7 genes and IHC for 3 protein.  Results: Microarray gene expression profiling was able to accurately categorize ACTs into ACCs and ACAs.  All 7 genes were strong discriminators of ACCs from ACAs on qPCR.  IHC with IGF2, MAD2L1, CCNB1 and Ki-67, but not ACADVL or ALOX15B, had high diagnostic accuracy in differentiating ACCs from ACAs.  The best results however were obtained with a combination of IGF2 and Ki-67 with 96% sensitivity and 100% specificity in diagnosing ACCs.  Conclusion: Microarray gene expression profiling accurately differentiates ACCs from ACAs.

Angiotensin II,GSE206779,35730579,PKN2 deficiency leads both to prenatal ‘congenital’ cardiomyopathy and defective angiotensin II stress responses,"Background: The protein kinase PKN2 is required for embryonic development, and PKN2 knockout mice die as a result of failure in expansion of mesoderm tissues, cardiac development and neural tube closure. In the adult, cardiomyocyte PKN2 and PKN1 (in combination) are required for cardiac adaptation to pressure-overload. The role of PKN2 in contractile cardiomyocytes during development and its role in the adult heart remain to be fully established.  Methods: We used mice with cardiomyocyte-directed knockout of PKN2 or global PKN2 haploinsufficiency. Cardiac function and dimensions were assessed with high resolution episcopic microscopy, MRI, micro-CT and echocardiography. Biochemical and histological changes were assessed. Results: Cardiomyocyte-directed PKN2 knockout embryos displayed striking abnormalities in the compact myocardium, with frequent myocardial clefts and diverticula, ventricular septal defects and abnormal heart shape. The sub-Mendelian homozygous knockout survivors developed cardiac failure. RNASeq data showed upregulation of PKN2 in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, suggesting an involvement in adult heart disease. Given the rarity of homozygous survivors with cardiomyocyte-specific deletion of PKN2, this was explored using mice with constitutive heterozygous PKN2 knockout. Cardiac hypertrophy resulting from hypertension induced by angiotensin II was reduced in haploinsufficient PKN2 mice relative to wild-type littermates, with suppression of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and cardiac fibrosis.  Conclusions: Cardiomyocyte PKN2 is essential for heart development and formation of compact myocardium, and is also required for cardiac hypertrophy in hypertension.

Background: The protein kinase PKN2 is required for embryonic development, and PKN2 knockout mice die as a result of failure in expansion of mesoderm tissues, cardiac development and neural tube closure. In the adult, cardiomyocyte PKN2 and PKN1 (in combination) are required for cardiac adaptation to pressure-overload. The role of PKN2 in contractile cardiomyocytes during development and its role in the adult heart remain to be fully established.  Methods: We used mice with cardiomyocyte-directed knockout of PKN2 or global PKN2 haploinsufficiency. Cardiac function and dimensions were assessed with high resolution episcopic microscopy, MRI, micro-CT and echocardiography. Biochemical and histological changes were assessed. Results: Cardiomyocyte-directed PKN2 knockout embryos displayed striking abnormalities in the compact myocardium, with frequent myocardial clefts and diverticula, ventricular septal defects and abnormal heart shape. The sub-Mendelian homozygous knockout survivors developed cardiac failure. RNASeq data showed upregulation of PKN2 in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, suggesting an involvement in adult heart disease. Given the rarity of homozygous survivors with cardiomyocyte-specific deletion of PKN2, this was explored using mice with constitutive heterozygous PKN2 knockout. Cardiac hypertrophy resulting from hypertension induced by angiotensin II was reduced in haploinsufficient PKN2 mice relative to wild-type littermates, with suppression of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and cardiac fibrosis.  Conclusions: Cardiomyocyte PKN2 is essential for heart development and formation of compact myocardium, and is also required for cardiac hypertrophy in hypertension. Thus, PKN signalling may offer therapeutic options for managing congenital and adult heart diseases.. This experiment was carried out using RNA derived from 4 groups, with 5 mice in each. Male mice with constitutive heterozygous PKN2 knockout, and wild-type male littermates, were treated with Angiotensin II or vehicle for 7 days. RNA was extracted from the apex of hearts..

We demonstrated that sex chromosomes influence regional development of angiotensin II (AngII)-induced aortopathies in mice. In this study, we determined if the number of X chromosomes regulates regional development of AngII-induced aortopathies.    Approach and Results:  We used females with varying numbers of X chromosomes (XXF or XOF) on an C57BL/6J (ascending aortopathies) or Ldlr-/- background (descending and abdominal aortopathies) compared to XY males (XYM). To induce aortopathies, mice were infused with AngII. XOF (C57BL/6J) exhibited larger percent increases in ascending aortic lumen diameters than AngII-infused XXF or XYM. AngII-infused XOF (Ldlr-/-) exhibited similar incidences of thoracic (XOF, 50%; XYM, 71%) and abdominal aortopathies (XOF, 83%; XYM, 71%) as XYM, which were greater than XXF (XXF, 0%). Abdominal aortic lumen diameters and maximal external diameters were similar between XOF and XYM but greater than XXF, and these effects persisted with extended AngII infusions. Larger aortic lumen diameters, abdominal aortopathy incidence (XXF, 20%; XOF, 75%), and maximal aneurysm diameters (XXF, 1.02 ± 0.17; XOF, 1.96 ± 0.32 mm; P=0.027) persisted in ovariectomized AngII-infused XOF mice. Data from RNA seq demonstrated that X chromosome genes that escape X-inactivation (histone lysine demethylases Kdm5c and Kdm6a), exhibited lower mRNA abundance in aortas of XOF than XXF (P=0.033 and 0.024 respectively). Conversely, DNA methylation was higher in aortas of XOF than XXF (P=0.038).      Conclusion: The absence of a second X chromosome promotes diffuse AngII-induced aortopathies in females.","Female C57BL/6J Ldlr-/- mice at 14-18 wks of age (n = 5 XX genotype, n =5 X0 genotype) were fed a Western (high fat- TD88137, Envigo) diet for 1 wk, and euthanized under ketamine/xylazine anesthesia (100:10mg/Kg).

Angiotensin II,GSE169734,33801629,Cardiac Oxidative Signaling and Physiological Hypertrophy in the Na/K-ATPase a1s/sa2s/s Mouse Model of High Affinity for Cardiotonic Steroids,"The Na/K-ATPase is the specific receptor for cardiotonic steroids (CTS) such as ouabain and digoxin. At pharmacological concentrations used in the treatment of cardiac conditions, CTS inhibit the ion-pumping function of Na/K-ATPase. At much lower concentrations, in the range of those reported for endogenous CTS in the blood, they stimulate hypertrophic growth of cultured cardiac myocytes through initiation of a Na/K-ATPase-mediated and reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent signaling. To examine a possible effect of endogenous concentrations of CTS on cardiac structure and function in vivo, we compared mice expressing the naturally resistant Na/K-ATPase α1 and age-matched mice genetically engineered to express a mutated Na/K-ATPase α1 with high affinity for CTS. In this model, total cardiac Na/K-ATPase activity, α1, α2 and β1 protein content remained unchanged, and the cardiac Na/K-ATPase dose-response curve to ouabain shifted to the left as expected. In males aged 3–6 months, increased α1 sensitivity to CTS resulted in a significant increase of cardiac carbonylated protein content, suggesting that ROS production was elevated. A moderate but significant increase of about 15% of the heart-weight-to-tibia-length ratio, accompanied by an increase of myocyte cross-sectional area was detected. Echocardiographic analyses did not reveal any change in cardiac function, and there was no fibrosis or re-expression of the fetal gene program.

The Na/K-ATPase is the specific receptor for cardiotonic steroids (CTS) such as ouabain and digoxin. At pharmacological concentrations used in the treatment of cardiac conditions, CTS inhibit the ion-pumping function of Na/K-ATPase. At much lower concentrations, in the range of those reported for endogenous CTS in the blood, they stimulate hypertrophic growth of cultured cardiac myocytes through initiation of a Na/K-ATPase-mediated and reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent signaling. To examine a possible effect of endogenous concentrations of CTS on cardiac structure and function in vivo, we compared mice expressing the naturally resistant Na/K-ATPase α1 and age-matched mice genetically engineered to express a mutated Na/K-ATPase α1 with high affinity for CTS. In this model, total cardiac Na/K-ATPase activity, α1, α2 and β1 protein content remained unchanged, and the cardiac Na/K-ATPase dose-response curve to ouabain shifted to the left as expected. In males aged 3–6 months, increased α1 sensitivity to CTS resulted in a significant increase of cardiac carbonylated protein content, suggesting that ROS production was elevated. A moderate but significant increase of about 15% of the heart-weight-to-tibia-length ratio, accompanied by an increase of myocyte cross-sectional area was detected. Echocardiographic analyses did not reveal any change in cardiac function, and there was no fibrosis or re-expression of the fetal gene program. RNA sequencing analysis indicated that pathways related to energy metabolism were upregulated, while those related to extracellular matrix organization were downregulated. Consistent with a functional role of the latter, an angiotensin-II challenge that triggered fibrosis in the α1r/rα2s/s mouse failed to do so in the α1s/sα2s/s.

Treatment options for HFpEF are limited, and development of novel therapeutics is hindered by the paucity of suitable preclinical HFpEF models that recapitulate the complexity of human HFpEF. Metabolic drugs, like Glucagon Like Peptide Receptor Agonist (GLP-1RA) and Sodium Glucose Transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i), have emerged as promising drugs to restore metabolic perturbations and may have value in the treatment of the cardiometabolic HFpEF phenotype. We aimed to develop a multifactorial HFpEF mouse model that closely resembles the cardiometabolic HFpEF phenotype, and evaluated the GLP-1 RA liraglutide and a SGLT2i dapagliflozin. Methods&Results: Aged (18-22 months old) female C57BL/6J mice were fed a standardized chow (CTRL) or high fat diet (HFD) for 12 weeks. After 8 weeks HFD, Angiotensin-II (ANGII), was administered for 4 weeks via osmotic mini-pumps. HFD+ANGII resulted in a cardiometabolic HFpEF phenotype, including obesity, impaired glucose handling and metabolic dysregulation with inflammation. The multiple-hit resulted in typical clinical HFpEF features, including cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis with preserved fractional shortening but with impaired myocardial deformation, atrial enlargement lung congestion, and elevated blood pressures. Treatment with liraglutide attenuated the cardiometabolic dysregulation and improved cardiac function, with reduced cardiac hypertrophy, less myocardial fibrosis, and attenuation of atrial weight, natriuretic peptide levels, and lung congestion. Dapagliflozin treatment improved glucose handling, but had mild effects on the HFpEF phenotype. Conclusions: We developed a mouse model that recapitulates the human HFpEF disease, providing a novel opportunity to study disease pathogenesis and development of enhanced therapeutic approaches.

Background—Aortic dissection (AD) is caused by disruption of the intima-media complex and tearing of the medial layer of the aorta. AD is life-threatening due to progressive destruction of the aorta, resulting in critical damage to organs. Recent studies reveal that the inflammatory response, including Jak/Stat signaling, is important in AD pathogenesis. However, it remains unclear how Jak/Stat signaling is involved in the tissue destruction in AD. Methods—Immunohistochemical analysis of human AD tissue revealed activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3) in medial SMCs. Stat3 activation was recapitulated in a mouse model of AD induced via β-aminopropionitrile and angiotensin II infusion. We also created a knockout mouse strain (smSocs3-KO) by deleting Socs3, a negative regulator of Jak/Stat signaling, specifically in mouse SMCs. Results—Compared to wild-type mice, smSocs3-KO mice developed a less severe AD phenotype that was associated with proinflammatory response at baseline, increased fibroblast and collagen deposition, and reinforced aortic tensile strength. Cell culture experiments revealed that Stat3 activation in SMCs caused secretion of factors that can stimulate fibroblast growth. Conclusions—Our present findings suggested that, although an acute inflammatory response is detrimental in AD, chronic activation of the SMC-mediated proinflammatory response was protective against aortic destruction in AD.","To achieve the smooth muscle-specific deletion of Socs3 (smSocs3-KO), we crossed mice that were homozygous for the floxed allele of Socs3 (Socs3fl/fl) and backcrossed to C57BL/6J for three generations, with SM22-Cre mice (JAX Mice, stock # 004746) that carried a Cre recombinase transgene under control of the smooth muscle SM22 promoter.

Angiotensin II,GSE59422,25244096,Effect of Hypertension of Dendritic Cell Gene Expression,"Oxidative injury and inflammation have been implicated in the genesis of hypertension but the mechanisms involved are not fully understood. We describe a new pathway in which angiotensin II promotes dendritic cell (DC) activation of T cells and ultimately hypertension.  NADPH oxidase-dependent superoxide production is increased 5-fold in DCs isolated from hypertensive mice as compared to sham-treated mice.  This is associated with DC accumulation of protein-isoketal adducts and production of IL-6, IL-1β and IL-23.  DCs from hypertensive mice but not sham mice promote survival and proliferation of CD8+ T cells in culture.  Chemically diverse isoketal scavengers not only prevent activation and immunogenicity of DCs, but also attenuate angiotensin II-induced hypertension.  Moreover, adaptive transfer of DCs from hypertensive mice prime development of hypertension in response to a subpressor dose of angiotensin II.  Exposure of DCs to tert butyl hypdroperoxide promoted isoketal formation, DC stimulation of CD8+ T cell proliferation and primed hypertension in response to low dose angiotensin II.  Serum isoprostanes, precursors to isoketals, were found to be elevated in humans with treated hypertension and were markedly elevated in patients with resistant hypertension.

A key question after this trial is whether the failure of torcetrapib was a result of CETP inhibition or of some other pharmacology of the molecule. The direct effects of torcetrapib and related molecules on adrenal steroid production were assessed in cell culture using the H295R as well as the newly developed HAC15 human adrenal carcinoma cell lines. Torcetrapib induced the synthesis of both aldosterone and cortisol in these two in vitro cell systems. Analysis of steroidogenic gene expression indicated that torcetrapib significantly induced the expression of CYP11B2 and CYP11B1, two enzymes in the last step of aldosterone and cortisol biosynthesis pathway, respectively. Transcription profiling indicated that torcetrapib and angiotensin II share overlapping pathways in regulating adrenal steroid biosynthesis. Hormone-induced steroid production is mainly mediated by two messengers, calcium and cAMP. An increase of intracellular calcium was observed after torcetrapib treatment, whereas cAMP was unchanged. Consistent with intracellular calcium being the key mediator of torcetrapib’s effect in adrenal cells, calcium channel blockers completely blocked torcetrapib-induced corticoid release and calcium increase.

We hypothesized that aging and obesity, which represent major risk factors for a variety of diseases, synergistically modify the epigenome of adult adipose stem cells (ASCs). Using integrated RNA- and targeted bisulfite-sequencing in murine ASCs from lean and obese mice at 5- and 12-months of age, we identified global DNA hypomethylation with either aging or obesity, and a synergistic effect of aging combined with obesity.

In parallel with this observation, transcriptomic and epigenomic analysis showed that B27-rat Tn exhibited a decreased expression of Interferon/Th1- and increased expression of Th17-related genes.

Approximately one-third of psoriasis patients develop joint involvement and are diagnosed with psoriatic arthritis (PsA). While, inIn adult-onset disease,  adults, the development of arthritis usually follows skin psoriasis, but approximately 15% experience arthritis first,  which can delay diagnosis.  While the pathophysiology of psoriasis and PsA is incompletely understood, epigenetic dysregulation affecting CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells has been suggested.  Objectives: This project aimed to identify disease-associated DNA methylation signatures in CD4+ T-cells from psoriasis and PsA patients that may be used as diagnostic and/or prognostic biomarkers.   Methods: PBMCs were collected from 12 patients with chronic plaque skin psoriasis and 8 PsA patients, and 8 healthy controls. CD4+ T-cells were separated through FACS sorting, and DNA methylation profiling was performed (Illumina EPIC850K arrays). Bioinformatic analyses, including gene ontology (GO) and KEGG pathway analysis, were performed using R software. To identify genes under the control of interferon (IFN), the Interferome database was consulted, and DNA Methylation Scores were calculated.  Results: Numbers and proportions of CD4+ T-cell subsets (naïve, central memory, effector memory, CD45RA re-expressing effector memory cells) did not vary between controls, skin psoriasis and PsA patients. 883 differentially methylated positions (DMPs) affecting 548 genes were identified between healthy controls and “all” psoriasis patients. Principal component and partial least-squares discriminant analysis separated controls from skin psoriasis and PsA patients. GO analysis considering promoter DMPs delivered hypermethylation of genes involved in “regulation of wound healing, spreading of epidermal cells”, “negative regulation of cell-substrate junction organization” and “negative regulation of focal adhesion assembly”.

Differentially expressed genes (DEG) were used to identify pathways and mechanisms. Published transcriptomic datasets from animal models and human OA were used to confirm and extend present findings. The total number of DEGs was already high at 2 weeks (723 in meniscus), followed by cartilage (259) and synovium (42) and declined to varying degrees in meniscus and synovium but increased in cartilage at 6 weeks. The most upregulated genes included tenascins. The 'response to mechanical stimulus' and extracellular matrix-related pathways were enriched in both cartilage and meniscus.

It is unclear, though, how this autoimmune disease progresses to the point of deterioration of the joint. Here, we report that in a mouse model of RA the upregulation of TLR2 expression and its a(2,3) sialylation in RANK+ myeloid monocytes mediate the transition from autoimmunity to osteoclast fusion and bone resorption, resulting in joint destruction. The expression of a(2,3) sialyltransferases were significantly increased in RANK+TLR2+ myeloid monocytes, and their inhibition or treatment with a TLR2 inhibitor blocked osteoclast fusion. Notably, analysis of our single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) libraries generated from RA mice revealed a novel RANK+TLR2- subset that negatively regulated osteoclast fusion. Importantly, the RANK+TLR2+ subset was significantly diminished with the treatments. Moreover, the RANK+TLR2- subset could differentiate into a TRAP+ osteoclast lineage, but the resulting cells did not fuse to form osteoclasts.

Biological activity of EVs is generally driven by their cargo, which might be influenced by microenvironment. Therefore, pre-conditioning strategies, including modifications in culture conditions or oxygen tension could directly impact on MSCs paracrine activity.   Methods: A xeno-free supplement (XFS) was used for isolation and expansion of MSCs and compared to conventional fetal bovine serum (FBS) culture. Bone Marrow-derived MSCs (BMSCs) were pre-conditioned under normoxia (20% O2) or under hypoxia (1% O2) and EVs production was evaluated. Anti-OA activity was evaluated by using an in vitro inflammatory model. miRNA content was also explored, to select putative miRNA that could be involved in a biological function.  Results: Modulation of IL-6, IL-8 and COX-2 was evaluated on hACs simultaneously treated with IL-1α and BMSC-derived EVs. FBS-sEVs exerted a blunt inhibitory effect, while a strong anti-inflammatory outcome was achieved by XFS-sEVs.

Inter- and intraindividual differences in the phenotype of arthritis often prevent early diagnosis and effective treatment. Previously, we suggested that site-specific differences in the joint stroma influence the development and the outcome of arthritis and showed that the long non-coding RNA HOTAIR is  expressed exclusively in synovial fibroblasts (SF) of lower joints. Here, we further analysed the function of HOTAIR in SF and in arthritis development. We show that joint-specific HOTAIR expression in SF is stronlgy imprinted in the chromatin landscape of SF by epigenetic mechanisms. Nevertheless, HOTAIR expression in knee SF was downregulated by inflammatory cytokines. Accordingly, HOTAIR was more expressed in OA tissues than in RA tissues. Downregulation of HOTAIR regulated relevant arthritis pathways by epigenetic and transcriptional mechanisms and modified the migratory function of SF, decreased SF mediated osteoclastogenesis, and increased the attraction of B cells by SF.

Extracellular vesicles (EVs) released in the synovial fluid (SF) of inflamed joints have gained increased recognition as mediators of arthritis pathogenesis and as a source of biomarkers. No standardized protocol is available, yet, for the analysis of EV-derived microRNAs (EV-miRs) in human SF specimens, and their potential as biomarkers in OJIA has not been explored. This study proposes an optimized procedure for profiling EV-miRs in SF and represents the first investigation of the miRNome in EV isolated from OJIA patients at disease onset. We present data showing efficient recovery of EVs from SF aspirates and optimal profiling of their miRNA content. We identified a subset of 15 EV-miRs whose expression was deregulated in SF. Analysis of EV-miRs target genes evidenced the enrichemnt of processes related to inflammation, cartilage/bone homeostasis, hypoxia, and hormone metabolism, suggesting their contribution to disease pathogenesis and potential as new putative biomarkers. In addition, we detected altered expression levels of several circulating EV-miRs able to discriminate new-onset OJIA patients from control children. Among them, 16 were consensually overexpressed in both PL and SF from OJIA patients respect to controls, potentially representing a disease-associated molecular “fingerprint” measurable at both the systemic and local levels with high diagnostic potential.

To test this assumption, Cn2r null mice and WT mice were aged to reach 20 months, and analyzed for joint structural  features.  OA was induced in Wild type (WT) mice via ageing or post-traumatic procedure, followed by HU308 systemic (intraperitoneal) or local (intra-articular) administration, respectively.  Additional analysis of time and dose courses for HU308 were carried out in human primary chondrocytes, analyzed by RNA-sequencing, RT-PCR, ChIP and immunoblotting.

Systemic administration of HU308 to 16-month mice improved pain sensitivity and maintained joint integrity, which was consistent with the intra-articular administration of HU308 in post-traumatic OA mice. When assessing human chondrocytes treated with HU308, we uncovered a dose- and time related increase in ACAN and COL2A1 expression, which was preceded by increased SOX9 expression due to pCREB transcriptional activation of the SOX9 gene. Finally, transcriptomic analysis of patient-derived human chondrocytes, identified HU308 populations exhibiting enhanced SOX9 expression, accompanied by enriched gene networks related to carbohydrate metabolism.

Sequence variants in enhancers controlling expression of the transcription factor PITX2, which is expressed in the cardiomyocytes (CMs) of the PV and left atrium (LA), have been implicated in AF predisposition. Single nuclei multiomic profiling of RNA and analysis of chromatin accessibility combined with spectral clustering uncovered distinct PV- and LA-enriched CM cell states. Pitx2 mutant PV and LA CMs exhibited gene expression changes consistent with cardiac dysfunction through cell-type-distinct, PITX2-directed, cis-regulatory grammars controlling target gene expression. The perturbed network targets in each CM were enriched in distinct human AF-predisposition genes, suggesting combinatorial risk for AF-genesis.

atrial fibrillation,GSE138255,33119050,Transcriptome and Proteome Mapping in the Sheep Atria Reveal Molecular Features of Atrial Fibrillation Progression,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is often a progressive cardiac arrhythmia that increases the risk of hospitalization and adverse cardiovascular events. There is a clear demand for more inclusive and large-scale approaches to understand the molecular drivers responsible for AF, as well as the fundamental mechanisms governing the transition from paroxysmal to persistent and permanent forms. We aimed to create a molecular map of AF and find the distinct genetic programs underlying cell type-specific atrial remodeling and AF progression. We used a sheep model of long-standing, tachypacing-induced AF, sampled right and left atrial tissue and isolated cardiomyocytes from control, intermediate (transition) and late time points during AF progression, and performed transcriptomic and proteome profiling. We have merged all these layers of information into a meaningful 3-component space in which we explored the genes and proteins detected and their common patterns of expression. Our data-driven analysis points at extracellular matrix remodeling, inflammation, ion channel, myofibril structure, mitochondrial complexes and chromatin remodeling as hallmarks of AF progression. Most important, we prove that these changes occur at early transitional stages of the disease, but not at later stages, and that the left atrium undergoes significantly more profound changes than the right atrium in its expression program. The pattern of dynamic changes in gene and protein expression correspond closely with the electrical and structural remodeling demonstrated previously in the sheep and in humans. The results provide novel insight into the dynamics of gene and protein expression changes that underlie AF-induced atrial remodeling and that make the arrhythmia become more stable and long lasting.","Left and right atrial appendages and posterior left appendage, whole-tissue and isolated cardiomyocytes, mRNA profiles of sham, transition and chronic sheeps were generated by deep sequencing, in triplicate, using Illumina Hiseq 2500.",Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,"Alba,,Alvarez-Franco, Raquel,,Rouco, Miguel,,Manzanares","Sheep, Domestic, genetics, Disease Progression, Proteome, Disease Models, Animal, Time Factors, Proteomics, Transcriptome, Male, physiopathology, metabolism, Heart Atria, Heart Rate, Gene Expression Profiling, Atrial Fibrillation, Animals, Action Potentials","Transcriptome and Proteome Mapping in the Sheep Atria Reveal Molecular Features of Atrial Fibrillation Progression.

We used a sheep model of long-standing, tachypacing-induced AF, sampled right and left atrial tissue and isolated cardiomyocytes from control, intermediate (transition) and late time points during AF progression, and performed transcriptomic and proteome profiling. We have merged all these layers of information into a meaningful 3-component space in which we explored the genes and proteins detected and their common patterns of expression. Our data-driven analysis points at extracellular matrix remodeling, inflammation, ion channel, myofibril structure, mitochondrial complexes and chromatin remodeling as hallmarks of AF progression. Most important, we prove that these changes occur at early transitional stages of the disease, but not at later stages, and that the left atrium undergoes significantly more profound changes than the right atrium in its expression program. The pattern of dynamic changes in gene and protein expression correspond closely with the electrical and structural remodeling demonstrated previously in the sheep and in humans. The results provide novel insight into the dynamics of gene and protein expression changes that underlie AF-induced atrial remodeling and that make the arrhythmia become more stable and long lasting.. Left and right atrial appendages and posterior left appendage, whole-tissue and isolated cardiomyocytes, mRNA profiles of sham, transition and chronic sheeps were generated by deep sequencing, in triplicate, using Illumina Hiseq 2500..

ZFP36 (TTP) is best known for regulating cytokine expression in myeloid cells; however, the mammalian paralogues ZFP36L1 and ZFP36L2 have not been viewed as important in controlling inflammation.  To study potential functional overlaps of these three TTP family proteins in myeloid cells, we developed myeloid-specific knock-out (M-KO) mice of these genes, singly and together.  M-Zfp36-KO mice exhibited a mild inflammatory syndrome late in life, while M-Zfp36l1-KO and M-Zfp36l2-KO mice had no apparent spontaneous phenotypes.  Mice with simultaneous deficiency of all three TTP family members in myeloid cells developed a severe, spontaneous, inflammatory phenotype, with a median survival of 8 weeks.

Using human cells and in vitro assays, we find only a very small number of B cells will adhere to TNF-activated (but not to resting) human microvascular endothelial cells (ECs) under conditions of venular flow and do so by binding to ICAM-1 and VCAM-1. CXCL13 and to a lesser extent CXCL10 bound to the ECs can increase adhesion and induce transendothelial migration (TEM) of adherent naïve and memory B cells in 10-15 minutes through a process involving cell spreading, translocation of the microtubule organizing center (MTOC) into a trailing uropod and interacting with EC ALCAM. Engagement of the BCR by EC-bound anti-κ light chain antibody also increases adhesion and TEM of κ+ but not λ+ B cells. BCR-induced TEM takes 30-60 minutes, requires Syk activation, is initiated by B cell rounding up and translocation of the MTOC to the region of the B cell adjacent to the EC and also utilizes EC ALCAM for TEM.

Tristetraprolin (TTP) is an RNA binding protein that regulates immune-related cytokines and chemokines by destabilizing target mRNAs. As TTP expression is known to decrease with age in myeloid cells, we used TTP-deficient (TTPKO) mice to model aged mice to study TTP regulation in age-related myelopoiesis. Both TTPKO and myeloidspecific TTPKO (cTTPKO) mice had significant increases in both MDSC subpopulations M-MDSCs (CD11b+Ly6ChiLy6G-) and PMN-MDSCs (CD11b+Ly6CloLy6G+), as well as macrophages (CD11b+F4/80+) in the spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes; however, no quantitative changes in MDSCs were observed in the bone marrow. In contrast, gain-of-function TTP knock-in (TTPKI) mice had no change in MDSCs compared with control mice.

Aging results in enhanced myelopoiesis, which is associated with an increased prevalence of myeloid leukemias and the production of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs).

Whereas the contributions of epithelial, immune and stromal cells in intestinal tissue integrity are well understood, the role of intrinsic neuroglia networks remains largely unknown. Here, we uncover pivotal roles of enteric glial cells (EGCs) in intestinal homeostasis, immunity and tissue repair. We demonstrate that infection of mice with Heligmosomoides polygyrus (H. poly) leads to enteric gliosis and upregulation of the interferon gamma (IFN-γ) gene signature.

Mechanistically, we show that upregulation of Cxcl10 is an early immediate response of EGCs to IFN-γ signaling and provide evidence that this chemokine and the downstream amplification of IFN-γ signaling in the TM are required for a measured inflammatory response to helminths and resolution of granulomatous pathology.

chemokines,GSE179111,34343496,CXCR6 Positions Cytotoxic T Cells to Receive Critical Survival Signals in the Tumor Microenvironment,"Cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses against tumors are maintained by stem-like memory cells that self-renew, but also give rise to effector-like cells. The latter gradually lose their anti-tumor activity and acquire an epigenetically fixed, hypofunctional state, leading to tumor tolerance. Here, we show that the conversion of stem-like into effector-like CTL involves a major chemotactic reprogramming that includes the upregulation of chemokine receptor CXCR6. This receptor positions effector-like CTL in a discrete perivascular niche of the tumor stroma that is densely occupied by CCR7+ dendritic cells (DC) expressing the CXCR6 ligand CXCL16. CCR7+ DC also express and trans-present the survival cytokine IL-15. CXCR6 expression and IL-15 trans-presentation are critical for the survival and local expansion of effector-like CTL in the tumor microenvironment to maximize their anti-tumor activity before progressing to irreversible dysfunction.

Cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses against tumors are maintained by stem-like memory cells that self-renew, but also give rise to effector-like cells. The latter gradually lose their anti-tumor activity and acquire an epigenetically fixed, hypofunctional state, leading to tumor tolerance. Here, we show that the conversion of stem-like into effector-like CTL involves a major chemotactic reprogramming that includes the upregulation of chemokine receptor CXCR6. This receptor positions effector-like CTL in a discrete perivascular niche of the tumor stroma that is densely occupied by CCR7+ dendritic cells (DC) expressing the CXCR6 ligand CXCL16. CCR7+ DC also express and trans-present the survival cytokine IL-15. CXCR6 expression and IL-15 trans-presentation are critical for the survival and local expansion of effector-like CTL in the tumor microenvironment to maximize their anti-tumor activity before progressing to irreversible dysfunction.

Some aminoglycosides that bind to the ribosome decoding centre can induce PTC readthrough and restore low levels of full-length functional proteins. However, concomitant inhibition of protein synthesis limits the extent of PTC readthrough that can be achieved by aminoglycosides like G418. Using a cell-based screen, we identified a small molecule, the phenylpyrazoleanilide Y-320, that potently enhances TP53, DMD and COL17A1 PTC readthrough by G418. Unexpectedly, Y-320 increased cellular protein levels and protein synthesis, measured by SYPRO Ruby protein staining and puromycin labelling, as well as ribosome biogenesis measured using antibodies to rRNA and ribosomal protein S6. Y-320 did not increase the rate of translation elongation and it exerted its effects independently of mTOR signaling. At the single cell level, exposure to Y-320 and G418 increased ribosome content and protein synthesis which correlated strongly with PTC readthrough. As a single agent, Y-320 did not affect translation fidelity measured using a luciferase reporter gene but it enhanced misincorporation by G418. RNA-seq data showed that Y-320 upregulated the expression of CXC chemokines CXCL10, CXCL8, CXCL2, CXCL11, CXCL3, CXCL1 and CXCL16. Several of these chemokines exert their cellular effects through the receptor CXCR2 and the CXCR2 antagonist SB225002 reduced cellular protein levels and PTC readthrough in cells exposed to Y-320 and G418. These data show that the self-limiting nature of PTC readthrough by G418 can be compensated by Y-320, a potent enhancer of PTC readthrough that increases ribosome biogenesis and protein synthesis. They also support a model whereby increased PTC readthrough is enabled by increased protein synthesis mediated by an autocrine chemokine signaling pathway.

NAFLD has become the most common cause of chronic liver disease in many countries, and its prevalence continues to rise in parallel with increasing rates of obesity. Here, we evaluated the putative NAFLD-attenuating effects of a multicomponent medicine consisting of 24 ingredients: Hepar compositum (HC-24).   Methods: Ldlr-/-.Leiden mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) with a macronutrient composition and cholesterol content comparable to human diets for 24 weeks to induce obesity-associated metabolic dysfunction, including hepatic steatosis and inflammation. HC-24 or vehicle control was administered intraperitoneally 3 times/week (1.5 ml/kg) for the last 18 weeks of the study. Histological analyses of liver and adipose tissue were combined with extensive hepatic transcriptomics analysis (next generation sequencing). Transcriptomics results were further substantiated with immunohistochemical and liver lipid analyses.   Results: HFD feeding induced obesity and metabolic dysfunction that was associated with adipose tissue inflammation and increased gut permeability. In the liver, HFD-feeding resulted in a disturbance of cholesterol homeostasis and an associated inflammatory response. HC-24 did not affect body weight, metabolic risk factors, adipose tissue inflammation or gut permeability. While HC-24 did not affect total liver steatosis, there was a pronounced reduction in lobular inflammation in HC-24-treated animals, which was associated with modulation of genes involved in inflammation (e.g. neutrophil chemokine Cxcl1) and cholesterol homeostasis (i.e. predicted effect on 'cholesterol' as an upstream regulator, based on gene expression changes associated with cholesterol handling).

To understand AM’s role in airway disease development, we examined the influence of Secretoglobin family 1a member 1 (SCGB1A1), a pulmonary surfactant protein, on AM development and function. In a murine model, high-throughput RNA-sequencing and gene expression analyses were performed on purified AMs isolated from mice lacking in Scgb1a1 gene and were compared with that from mice expressing wild type Scgb1a1 at weaning (4wk), puberty (8wk), early adult (12wk) and middle age (40wk). AMs from early adult mice under Scgb1a1 sufficiency demonstrated a total of 37 upregulated biological pathways compared to that at weaning, from which 30 were directly involved with antigen presentation, anti-viral immunity and inflammation. Importantly, these pathways under Scgb1a1 deficiency were significantly downregulated compared to that in the age-matched Scgb1a1-sufficient counterparts. Furthermore, AMs from Scgb1a1-deficient mice showed an early activation of inflammatory pathways compared with that from Scgb1a1-sufficient mice.

Huntington Disease,GSE241430,38066314,Longitudinal modeling of human neuronal aging reveals the contribution of the RCAN1-TFEB pathway to Huntington's disease neurodegeneration,"Aging is a common risk factor in neurodegenerative disorders and the ability to investigate aging of neurons in an isogenic background would facilitate discovering the interplay between neuronal aging and onset of neurodegeneration. Here, we perform direct neuronal reprogramming of longitudinally collected human fibroblasts to reveal genetic pathways altered at different ages. Comparative transcriptome analysis of longitudinally aged striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs), a primary neuronal subtype affected in Huntington's disease (HD), identified pathways associated with RCAN1, a negative regulator of calcineurin. Notably, RCAN1 undergoes age-dependent increase at the protein level detected in reprogrammed MSNs as well as in human postmortem striatum. In patient-derived MSNs of adult-onset HD (HD-MSNs), counteracting RCAN1 by gene knockdown (KD) rescued HD-MSNs from degeneration. The protective effect of RCAN1 KD was associated with enhanced chromatin accessibility of genes involved in longevity and autophagy, mediated through enhanced calcineurin activity, which in turn dephosphorylates and promotes nuclear localization of TFEB transcription factor. Furthermore, we reveal that G2-115 compound, an analog of glibenclamide with autophagy-enhancing activities, reduces the RCAN1-Calcineurin interaction, phenocopying the effect of RCAN1 KD. Our results demonstrate that RCAN1 is a potential genetic or pharmacological target whose reduction-of-function increases neuronal resilience to neurodegeneration in HD through chromatin reconfiguration.","To investigate age-related differences in reprogrammed MSNs from longitudinally collected fibroblasts from three independent healthy individuals, we carried out comparative transcriptome analysis between the age groups.

In order to cope with misfolding and aggregation, cells have evolved an elaborate network of molecular chaperones, composed of different families. But while chaperoning mechanisms for different families are well established, functional and regulatory diversification within chaperone families is still largely a mystery. Here we decided to explore chaperone functional diversity, through the lens of pathological aggregation. We revealed that different naturally-occurring isoforms of DNAJ chaperones showed differential effects on different types of aggregates. We performed a chaperone screen for modulators of two neurodegeneration-related aggregating proteins, the Huntington’s disease-related HTT-polyQ, and the ALS-related mutant FUS (mutFUS). The screen identified known modulators of HTT-polyQ aggregation, confirming the validity of our approach.  Surprisingly, modulators of mutFUS aggregation were completely different than those of HTT-polyQ. Interestingly, different naturally-occurring isoforms of DNAJ chaperones had opposing effects on HTT-polyQ vs. mutFUS aggregation. We identified a complex of the full length (FL) DNAJB14 and DNAJB12 isoforms which substantially alleviated mutFUS aggregation, in an HSP70-dependent manner. Their naturally occurring short isoforms were unable to form the complex, nor to interact with HSP70, and lost their ability to reduce mutFUS aggregation. In contrast, the short isoform of DNAJB12 significantly alleviated HTT-polyQ aggregation, while DNAJB12-FL aggravated HTT-polyQ aggregation. Finally, we demonstrated that full-length DNAJB14 ameliorated mutFUS aggregation compared to DNAJB14-short in primary neurons.

Although mechanisms of neuronal toxicity are not well delineated, transcriptional dysregulation is a likely contributor. Chromatin modifiers are implicated in both mechanisms of CAG instability and transcriptional dysregulation. Here, we tested whether histone deacetylase genes Hdac2 and Hdac3 modify molecular and cellular phenotypes in HttQ111 knock-in mice using conditional knockouts in striatal medium-spiny striatal neurons (MSNs) exhibiting extensive CAG expansion and exquisite disease vulnerability.

To assess the basis for white matter involution in HD, we generated bipotential glial progenitor cells (GPCs) from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), derived from either huntingtin (mHTT)-mutant embryos or normal controls, and performed RNA sequence analysis to assess mHTT-dependent changes in gene expression. In hGPCs derived from 3 distinct mHTT-expressing hESC lines, a set of transcription factors associated with glial differentiation and myelin synthesis was sharply down-regulated, relative to normal hESC GPCs. In particular, NKX2.2, OLIG2, SOX10 and MYRF were all suppressed, with the consequent diminution of myelinogenesis-associated transcription. Accordingly, when mHTT-expressing hGPCs were transplanted into hypomyelinated shiverer mice, the resultant mHTT glial chimeras were hypomyelinated.

To understand the mechanism/s underlying this association, biological processes enriched in NK cell-infiltrated as compared to NK cell-desert HER2-positive breast tumors paired by TIL score were leveraged from transcriptomic data. NK cell-infiltrated tumors were enriched in transcripts regulated by interferons and NF-kB. Among them, levels of CCL5/IFNG-CXCL9/10 positively correlated with the number of TI-NK cells in the original biopsy.

Given the role of self-RNA and biological sex in SLE pathogenesis, we investigated which sex-biased self-RNAs are potentially responsible for aberrant TLR7 activation in SLE. We used recent revelations about TLR7 sequence specificity and publicly available RNA sequencing data to identify sex-biased sources of self-RNA containing TLR7 ligands. We found X-inactive specific transcript (XIST) to be a particularly rich source of TLR7 ligands that is specifically expressed in women. We then investigated the capacity of XIST to act as a TLR7 ligand in vitro and found that multiple fragments of XIST induce IFNα production in a TLR7-dependent manner more than control RNA of equal length. Furthermore, we found that RNA isolated from XIST-knockout cells have significantly reduced capacity to stimulate TLR7 compared to RNA from wild-type cells.

We have previously observed that lung infection with attenuated bacteria M. bovis BCG achieved though intravenous (iv) administration provides strong protection against SARS-CoV-2 (SCV2) infection and disease in two mouse models. Assessment of the pulmonary cytokine milieu revealed that iv BCG induces a robust IFNγ response and low levels of IFNβ.

We report that IFNγ is required for iv BCG induced reduction in pulmonary viral loads and that this outcome is dependent on IFNγ receptor expression by non-hematopoietic cells. Further analysis revealed that BCG infection promotes the upregulation of ISGs with reported anti-viral activity by pneumocytes and bronchial epithelial cells in an IFNγ dependent manner, suggesting a possible mechanism for the observed protection. Finally, we confirmed the importance of IFNγ in these anti-viral effects by demonstrating that the recombinant cytokine itself provides strong protection against SCV2 challenge when administered intranasally.

Despite utilizing the same JAK-STAT signaling cascade, type I and III IFN receptors produce different magnitudes and dynamics in the phosphorylation of signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs), gene transcription and antiviral responses. Prior studies have tested the role of ligand binding affinity and receptor expression level on IFN receptor signaling strength; however, the ability of intracellular domains to differentiate type I and III IFN signaling has not been previously examined. Therefore, we engineered synthetic, heterodimeric type I and III IFN receptors that can be stably expressed at similar levels in human cells and respond to the same ligand. Even when controlling for ligand binding and receptor expression, we find that our synthetic type I receptors produce a greater magnitude of STAT phosphorylation and gene expression than the corresponding type III receptors. Furthermore, our results show that short <55 amino acid “box motifs” known to bind JAK1 are sufficient to encode differences between type I and III receptors.

Despite utilizing the same JAK-STAT signaling cascade, type I and III IFN receptors produce different magnitudes and dynamics in the phosphorylation of signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs), gene transcription and antiviral responses. Prior studies have tested the role of ligand binding affinity and receptor expression level on IFN receptor signaling strength; however, the ability of intracellular domains to differentiate type I and III IFN signaling has not been previously examined. Therefore, we engineered synthetic, heterodimeric type I and III IFN receptors that can be stably expressed at similar levels in human cells and respond to the same ligand. Even when controlling for ligand binding and receptor expression, we find that our synthetic type I receptors produce a greater magnitude of STAT phosphorylation and gene expression than the corresponding type III receptors. Furthermore, our results show that short <55 amino acid “box motifs” known to bind JAK1 are sufficient to encode differences between type I and III receptors. Altogether, our work indicates that specific regions within the intracellular domains of IFNAR2 and IFNLR1 encode different downstream signaling strengths that allow type I and III receptors to produce distinct signaling outcomes..

[CRISPR screen],"Interferon-gamma (IFNg) exerts potent growth inhibitory (antiproliferative/pro-apoptotic) effects on a wide range of tumors, including melanoma. While several terminal effectors of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis have been identified, a definitive account of the signaling pathway leading to these events is lacking. We set up a chemical genomics screen and a whole genome targeting CRISPR/Cas9 screen in a growth inhibition (GI)-sensitive patient-derived melanoma (PDM) cell line. Drug screening revealed that treatment with RAF and ERK inhibitors disrupted IFNg GI in PDM cells. For the CRISPR screen, the gene-level analysis showed that the magnitude of enrichment for guide RNAs targeting ERK2 in IFNg-treated cells was comparable to core IFNg signaling proteins like IFNGR2, JAK1, JAK2, and STAT1. We validated the involvement of ERK by detecting a sustained increase in phospho-ERK1/2 (p-ERK) levels following IFNg treatment. In live imaging experiments, we found that an ERK inhibitor (ERKi) blocks the induction of cell death in 17 of 23 (~74%) IFNg-sensitive PDM lines covering all the MAPK mutant and triple wildtype molecular subtypes. Through gene expression analysis, we found that IFNg-ERK signaling triggered the expression of stress response genes and subsequent upregulation of DR5 and NOXA, which were both critical for the induction of cell death. In summary, the IFNg-ERK signaling axis mediates cell death downstream of IFNg treatment in melanoma cells.

There is good evidence that arboviruses “prime” their progeny for infection of the next host, such as differential glycosylation of their outer glycoproteins or packaging of host ribosomal subunits. We and others have previously shown that mosquito derived viruses more efficiently infect mammalian cells than mammalian derived viruses. These observations are coherent with arboviruses acquiring host-specific adaptations, and we hypothesized that virus derived from either the mammalian host or mosquito vector will elicit different responses when infecting the mammalian host. Here we perform an RNA-sequencing analysis of the transcriptional response of Human Embryonic Kidney 293 (HEK-293) cells to infection with either mosquito (Aedes albopictus, C7/10) or mammalian (Baby Hamster Kidney, BHK) derived Sindbis virus (SINV). We show that C7/10 derived virus infection leads to a more robust transcriptional response in HEK-293s as compared to infection with the BHK derived virus. Surprisingly, despite more efficient infection, we found an increase in interferon-β (IFN-β) and interferon stimulated gene (ISG) transcripts in response to C7/10 derived virus infection versus BHK derived virus infection. However, translation of interferon stimulated genes was lower in HEK-293s infected with C7/10 derived virus, starkly contrasting with the transcriptional response. This inhibition of ISG translation is reflective of a more rapid overall shut-off of host cell translation following infection with C7/10 derived virus. Finally, we show that C7/10 derived virus infection of HEK-293 cells leads to elevated levels of phosphorylated eukaryotic translation elongation factor-2 (eEF2), identifying a potential mechanism leading to the more rapid shut-off of host translation.

In this study, we further assessed the role of ORF6 during infection using recombinant SARS-CoV-2 viruses carrying either a deletion or a well characterized M58R loss-of-function mutation in ORF6. We unambiguously show that ORF6 plays a key non-redundant role in the antagonism of IFN signaling by interfering with karyopherin-mediated nuclear import during SARS-CoV-2 infection both in vitro, and in the Syrian hamster model in vivo. In addition, we found that by contributing to the inhibition of cellular mRNA export, ORF6 expression significantly remodels the host cell proteome upon infection. Importantly, we also unravel a previously unrecognized function of ORF6 in the modulation of viral protein expression, which is independent of its function at the nuclear pore. Lastly, we characterized the ORF6 D61L mutation that recently emerged in Omicron BA.2 and BA.4 subvariants and demonstrated that it is able to disrupt ORF6 protein functions at the NPC and to impair SARS-CoV-2 innate immune evasion strategies.

Current diagnostic tests are either unreliable (IgE, skin prick test), or resource-intensive with risks (food challenges). Here we set out to determine if allergen-specific T cells in cow milk allergic (CMA) patients have a distinct quality and/or quantity that could potentially be used as a diagnostic marker. Starting from cow milk extract, we mapped T cell responses to a set of reactive epitopes that we compiled in a peptide pool. This pool induced cytokine responses in in vitro cultured cells distinguishing allergic from non-allergic subjects. Using single-cell RNA and paired TCR sequencing we detected significant changes in the transcriptional program and clonality of cow milk antigen-specific (CM+) T cells elicited by the pool in allergic vs. non-allergic subjects ex vivo. CM+ T cells from allergic subjects had increased percentages of FOXP3+ over FOXP3- cells. FOXP3+ cells are often equated with regulatory T cells (Tregs) that have suppressive activity, but CM+ FOXP3+ cells from allergic subjects showed significant expression of interferon-responsive genes and dysregulated chemokine receptor expression compared to non-allergic subjects, suggesting that these are not conventional Tregs. The CM+ FOXP3+ cells were also more clonally expanded than the FOXP3- population. We were further able to utilize surface markers (CD25, CD127, CCR7) in combination with our peptide pool stimulation to quantify these CM+ FOXP3+ cells by a simple flow cytometry assay. We show increased percentages of CM+ CD127-CD25+ cells from CMA subjects in an independent cohort, which could be used for diagnostic purposes. Looking specifically for Th2 cells normally associated with allergic diseases, we found a small population of clonally expanded CM+ cells that were significantly increased in CMA subjects and that had high expression of Th2 cytokines and pathogenic Th2/Tfh markers. Overall, these findings suggest that there are several differences in the phenotype of CM+ T cells with CM allergy and that the increase in CM+ FOXP3+ cells is a potential diagnostic marker of an allergic state.

interferons,GSE237377,37794185,The PTPN2/N1 inhibitor ABBV-CLS-484 unleashes potent anti-tumour immunity [TIL_RNAseq],"Immune checkpoint blockade is effective for some cancer patients, but most are refractory to current immunotherapies and new approaches are needed to overcome resistance. The protein tyrosine phosphatases PTPN2 and PTPN1 are central regulators of inflammation, and their genetic deletion in either tumour or immune cells promotes anti-tumour immunity. However, phosphatases are challenging drug targets and in particular, the active site has been considered undruggable. Here, we present the discovery and characterization of ABBV-CLS-484 (AC484), a first-in-class, orally bioavailable, potent PTPN2/N1 active site inhibitor. AC484 treatment in vitro amplifies the response to interferon and promotes the activation and function of several immune cell subsets. In murine cancer models resistant to PD-1 blockade, AC484 monotherapy generates potent anti-tumour immunity. We show that AC484 inflames the tumour microenvironment and promotes NK and CD8+ T cell function by enhancing JAK-STAT signaling and reducing T cell dysfunction.

Immune checkpoint blockade is effective for some cancer patients, but most are refractory to current immunotherapies and new approaches are needed to overcome resistance. The protein tyrosine phosphatases PTPN2 and PTPN1 are central regulators of inflammation, and their genetic deletion in either tumour or immune cells promotes anti-tumour immunity. However, phosphatases are challenging drug targets and in particular, the active site has been considered undruggable. Here, we present the discovery and characterization of ABBV-CLS-484 (AC484), a first-in-class, orally bioavailable, potent PTPN2/N1 active site inhibitor. AC484 treatment in vitro amplifies the response to interferon and promotes the activation and function of several immune cell subsets. In murine cancer models resistant to PD-1 blockade, AC484 monotherapy generates potent anti-tumour immunity. We show that AC484 inflames the tumour microenvironment and promotes NK and CD8+ T cell function by enhancing JAK-STAT signaling and reducing T cell dysfunction.

In this study, RNA-seq was used to perform differential gene expression (DEG) and gene ontology (GO) analyses in prostate tumors treated with different immunotherapies and their combination. This was in order to investigate which pathways are activated and mediate the therapeutic effect.  Methods: Mice with TRAMP-C2 subcutaneous prostate tumors were treated with either HBSS (control) or cyto-IL-15 or the STING agonist ADU-S100 or combination of ADU-S100 and cyto-IL-15. At day 6, tumors were removed and RNA was harvested to be used for RNA sequencing with Illumina NovaSeq. Using DESeq2, a comparison of gene expression between the treatment cohorts was performed and the Wald test was used to generate p-values and Log2 fold changes. GO analysis was performed on the statistically significant genes by implementing GeneSCF software using Fisher exact test. The mgi GO list was used to cluster the set of genes based on their biological process.   Results: DEG analysis shown that more than 1,000 genes were differentially expressed in tumors 6 days after treatment with ADU-S100 or its combination with cyto-IL-15 (1,040 genes for ADU-S100 compared to control; 1,141 genes for combination compared to control). Most of the differentially expressed genes were upregulated (>70% in both comparisons). cyto-IL-15 led to differential expression of 96 genes compared to control. Differential expressed genes included Cxcl11 involved in immune cell recruitment and activation, and genes encoding granzymes a and b, which are proteases released by cytotoxic T cells and natural killer (NK) cells to kill cancer cells. In the control versus ADU-S100 or combination comparisons, GO analysis revealed that the majority of genes were involved in processes such as cellular responses to interferon-γ and β, complement activation, innate immune response, phagocytosis, and B cell signalling and activation.   Conclusions: This study provides valuable insights in differential expression and activation of genes and cellular pathways involved in eliciting responses to immunotherapies in mouse prostate tumors.

Here, we report that the oncogenic MUC1-C protein is necessary for inducing chromatin accessibility and activation of the STAT1 and IRF1 genes in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. Our results demonstrate that MUC1-C activates the PBRM1 subunit of the SWI/SNF PBAF chromatin remodeling complex and forms a nuclear complex with PBRM1. We show that MUC1-C associates with PBRM1 and STAT1 on the IRF1 gene at (i) a proximal enhancer-like signature (PLS), and (ii) distal enhancer-like signatures (dELSs). We also show MUC1-C and PBRM1 are necessary for opening chromatin at these signatures and for the induction of IRF1 expression. In extending these results, we found that MUC1-C binds directly to IRF1 and forms nuclear complexes with PBRM1 and IRF1, which are necessary for inducing chromatin accessibility at PLS of the (i) STAT1 gene, (ii) type II IFN pathway IDO1 and WARS genes, and (iii) type I IFN pathway RIG-I, MDA5 and ISG15 genes.

In leukocytes or fibroblasts stimulated in vitro, IRF1-dependent responses to IFN-γ are, both quantitatively and qualitatively, much stronger than those to IFN-α/β. Moreover, IRF1-deficient mononuclear phagocytes do not control mycobacteria and related pathogens normally when stimulated with IFN-γ. By contrast, IFN-α/β-dependent intrinsic immunity to nine viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, is almost normal in IRF1-deficient fibroblasts. Human IRF1 is essential for IFN-γ-dependent macrophagic immunity to mycobacteria, but largely redundant for IFN-α/β-dependent antiviral immunity..

However, the molecular mechanisms controlling immunosuppressive myeloid cell states are ill- defined, hampering the development of myeloid-targeted therapies for cancer1,2. Here, we transcriptionally profiled over 500,000 tumor infiltrating leukocytes in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients and in the KrasG12DTp53-/- (KP) murine lung adenocarcinoma model. In both species, the Type 2 cytokine IL-4 was predicted to be the primary driver of tumor infiltrating monocyte-derived macrophage (mo-mac) phenotype, despite the fact that lung tumors were largely devoid of IL-4 producing cells. Using a panel of conditional knockout mice, we found that only deletion of IL-4Ra within early myeloid progenitors in bone marrow (BM) reduced lung tumor burden, while deletion of this receptor in downstream mature myeloid cells had no effect. Detailed transcriptional analysis followed by mechanistic studies in vivo revealed an essential role for local BM IL-4 signaling in reprograming myelopoiesis in cancer. Mechanistically, basophils and eosinophils within BM upregulated IL4 production upon sensing distal tumor cues; local BM IL-4 acted on granulocyte-monocyte progenitors to transcriptionally program the development of immunosuppressive myeloid cells, which then homed to the tumor and promoted tumor growth. Consequentially, specific depletion of basophils, which were enriched in BM but absent from the tumor, profoundly reduced tumor burden and normalized myelopoiesis in experimental lung tumors. Prompted by these results, we designed and initiated the first clinical trial of dupilumab, a humanized IL- 4Ra blocking antibody commonly used for atopic disease, given in conjunction with PD-(L)1 blockade in relapsed/refractory NSCLC patients who had progressed on standard chemoimmunotherapy combinations. Consistent with our preclinical mouse data, dupilumab drove a reduction in circulating monocytes. This was coupled with an expansion of circulating and tumor-infiltrating CD8 T cells. Notably, one out of the six patients who enrolled in Phase 1b of this trial exhibited significant decrease in his tumor burden after two months of dupilumab treatment, and the clinical response deepened further to a near complete response even after cessation of dupilumab, suggestive of successful reprogramming of the antitumor response. Collectively, our study defines a role for IL-4 signaling in lung tumor progression, identifies a central axis controlling immunosuppressive myelopoiesis in cancer, and highlights a novel combination therapy for immune checkpoint blockade in humans.","For all mouse scRNA-seq analyses, three mice were analyzed per condition.

Here we demonstrate that IL-15 is a critical CTCL growth and survival factor. Importantly, a genetically engineered immunodeficient mouse model expressing human IL-15 uniquely supported the growth of patient derived Sezary cells relative to conventional immunodeficient mouse strains. Patient derived xenograft (PDX) SS models recapacitated the pathologic features of the human disease, including skin infiltration and spread of leukemic cells to the periphery, and maintained the dependence on human IL-15 upon serial in vivo passaging.

Following mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infection, Bhlhe40 was the most highly induced transcription factor in NK cells among the basic helix-loop-helix family. Bhlhe40 upregulation in NK cells depended upon IL-12 and IL-18 signals, with the promoter of Bhlhe40 enriched for STAT4 and the permissive histone H3K4me3, and STAT4-deficient NK cells showing an impairment of Bhlhe40 induction and diminished H3K4me3.

While attenuated IL-2 increases Treg selectivity, the question remains as to whether a weakened IL-2 signal sufficiently enhances Treg suppressive function(s) toward disease modification.  To understand this question, we characterized the in vivo activity and transcriptomic profiles of two different attenuated IL-2 muteins in comparison with wildtype (WT) IL-2. Our study showed that, in addition to favoring Tregs, the attenuated muteins induced disproportionately robust effects on Treg activation and conversion to effector Treg (eTreg) phenotype.

Epithelial regeneration after ischemia and IBD suggests intestinal stem cells (ISCs) are highly tolerant to acute and chronic hypoxia; however, the impact of acute and chronic hypoxia on human ISC (hISC) properties have not been reported. Here we present a new microphysiological system (MPS) to investigate how hypoxia affects hISCs isolated from healthy human tissues. We then test the hypothesis that some inflammation-associated interleukins protect hISCs during prolonged hypoxia.   Methods: hISCs were exposed to <1.0% oxygen in the MPS for 6-, 24-, 48- & 72hrs. Viability, HIF1a response, transcriptomics, cell cycle dynamics, and hISC response to cytokines were evaluated.   Results: The novel MPS enables precise, real-time control and monitoring of oxygen levels at the cell surface. Under hypoxia, hISCs maintain viability until 72hrs and exhibit peak HIF1a at 24hrs. hISCs lose stem cell activity at 24hrs that recovers at 48hrs of hypoxia.

However, the role of TOX in other Th cell subtypes is less clear. In our study, we show that TOX is expressed in several physiologically-activated Th subtypes and its ectopic expression modestly enhances the in vitro differentiation of  Th2 and Treg cells.

In a murine model of psoriasis, IL-14 and IL-18 are significantly higher expressed in psoriasis-like skin lesions than in normal skin. In an analysis of serum samples from psoriasis patients, IL-18 shows higher expression in psoriasis patients compared to controls, and serum levels in psoriasis responded to treatment with IL-17 inhibitors.. Human skin biopsies of lesional skin from patients suffering from plaque-type psoriasis were isolated using the Whole Skin Dissociation Kit (Miltenyi, Gladbach, Germany) and analyzed using 10x Genomics RNAseq..

Interleukin (IL)-10 is a potent anti-inflammatory factor. However, its role in ALI resolution remains unclear. We investigated the effects of IL-10 during the ALI resolution process in a murine lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI model. Blockade of IL-10 signaling aggravates LPS-induced lung injury, as manifested by elevated pro-inflammatory factors production and increased neutrophils recruitment to the lung .Thereafter, we used IL-10 GFP reporter mice to discern the source cell of IL-10 during ALI. We found that IL-10 is predominantly generated by B cells during the ALI recovery process. Furthermore, we used IL-10-specific loss in B-cell mice to elucidate the effect of B-cell-derived IL-10 on the ALI resolution process. IL-10-specific loss in B cells leads to increased pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, persistent leukocyte infiltration, and prolonged alveolar barrier damage. Mechanistically, B cell-derived IL-10 inhibits the activation and recruitment of macrophages and downregulates the production of chemokine KC that recruits neutrophils to the lung.

lymphoma,GSE27226,21772049,HDACI and DAC induce specific epigenetic profile in DLBCL,"Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common type of lymphoid neoplasm in the world representing 30-40% of all lymphomas. Standard immunochemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone and rituximab) ensures cure in 60 to 65% of patients, while the rest progress or relapse. While advances have been made in the treatment of DLBCL, especially with the addition of rituximab, it is now apparent that there may be significant differences in prognosis that are related to the cell of origin, and that this disease is heterogeneous and novel treatment options are needed. It has been hypothesized that the combination of HDACI and hypomethylating agents might be a new approach to the treatment of relapsed or refractory DLBCL. This combination is thought to disrupt the transcription repressor complex consisting of methyl binding domain proteins (MBDP) and histone deacetylases (HDACs). We have explored the effect of different HDACI and decitabine combinations in in vitro and in vivo models of DLBCL. These data suggest a class effect, with all four HDACI (panobinostat, belinostat, vorinostat, depsipeptide) synergizing with decitabine in cytotoxicity assay across the spectrum of DLBCL cells. Synergy was validated in a number of other assays including a caspase 3 activation and apoptosis. Furthermore, the combination of panobinostat and decitabine induced markedly increased histone acetylation. The in vitro observations were confirmed in an in vivo murine xenograft experiment with the Ly1 DLBCL line. Genome wide methylation analysis and gene expression profiling demonstrated that the combination of these two epigenetic therapies produced a unique gene expression profile  compared to the samples treated with single drugs.  These data strongly support the potential therapeutic role of a combinatorial epigenetic platform for the treatment of B-cell lymphomas, in particular in patients with DLBCL. Clearly, future studies will need to focus on integrating the appropriate correlative studies, with an effort to identify and or validate biomarkers of activity with these combinations. The likelihood moving forward is that the mechanism of action of these combinations may vary from disease context to disease context.  Genome-wide array findings from these kinds of studies could be expanded to samples from patients on clinical trials to identify novel biomarkers of response, leading to the rational treatment of individual diseases based upon the underlying pathogenesis.","We have used single samples from three DLBCL cell lines (biological replicates) which were treated with DMSO, decitabine alone, panobinostat alone and their combination for 48h - total of 12 samples",Expression profiling by array,"Matko,,Kalac, Luigi,,Scotto, Enrica,,Marchi, Jennifer,,Amengual, Venkatraman,E,Seshan, Govind,,Bhagat, Netha,,Ulahannan, Violetta,V,Leshchenko, Samir,,Parekh, Benjamin,,Tycko, Owen,A,O'Connor","Cell Line, Tumor, Decitabine, Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays, Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse, Humans, pharmacology, Hydroxamic Acids, Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic, genetics, Mice, SCID, Panobinostat, DNA Methylation, Epigenesis, Genetic, drug effects, Apoptosis, Azacitidine, Indoles, metabolism, analogs & derivatives, Mice, pathology, Animals, drug therapy, Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors, Drug Synergism, Histones, Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic, Acetylation","HDACI and DAC induce specific epigenetic profile in DLBCL.

These data suggest a class effect, with all four HDACI (panobinostat, belinostat, vorinostat, depsipeptide) synergizing with decitabine in cytotoxicity assay across the spectrum of DLBCL cells. Synergy was validated in a number of other assays including a caspase 3 activation and apoptosis. Furthermore, the combination of panobinostat and decitabine induced markedly increased histone acetylation. The in vitro observations were confirmed in an in vivo murine xenograft experiment with the Ly1 DLBCL line. Genome wide methylation analysis and gene expression profiling demonstrated that the combination of these two epigenetic therapies produced a unique gene expression profile  compared to the samples treated with single drugs.  These data strongly support the potential therapeutic role of a combinatorial epigenetic platform for the treatment of B-cell lymphomas, in particular in patients with DLBCL. Clearly, future studies will need to focus on integrating the appropriate correlative studies, with an effort to identify and or validate biomarkers of activity with these combinations. The likelihood moving forward is that the mechanism of action of these combinations may vary from disease context to disease context.  Genome-wide array findings from these kinds of studies could be expanded to samples from patients on clinical trials to identify novel biomarkers of response, leading to the rational treatment of individual diseases based upon the underlying pathogenesis.. We have used single samples from three DLBCL cell lines (biological replicates) which were treated with DMSO, decitabine alone, panobinostat alone and their combination for 48h - total of 12 samples.

We illustrate with a high degree of detail that cancer is more than rampant cellular proliferation, but involves the additional transcriptional mobilization of many genes, some of them poorly characterized, which show a tumor-specific pattern of gene expression.. 26 samples are included in this series.  Sporadic murine E-mu-BRD2 mediated lymphomas are divided into three classes by disease severity and compared to either resting or mitogen-activated B Cells.  The resting and activated B Cells are either wildtype or E-mu-BRD2 transgenic.  All samples are on the FVB wildtype background.. Expression profiling by array.

Thus, novel therapeutic strategies are urgently needed. As the anti-CD20 antibody rituximab and the CD19-targeting antibody tafasitamab share distinct modes of actions, we investigated if dual-targeting of aggressive lymphoma B-cells by combining rituximab and tafasitamab might increase cytotoxic effects.  Experimental Design: Antibody single and combination efficacy was determined investigating different modes of action including direct cytotoxicity, antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) in vitro and in vivo models of aggressive B-cell lymphoma comprising diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and Burkitt lymphoma (BL).  Results: Overall, three different sensitivity profiles to antibody monotherapy or combination treatment were observed in in vitro models: while 2/11 cell lines were primarily sensitive to tafasitamab and 2/11 were predominantly sensitive to rituximab treatment, the combination of tafasitamab and rituximab resulted in enhanced cell death in 7/11 cell lines in at least one mode of action. Treatment with either antibody or the combination   resulted in decreased expression of the oncogenic transcription factor MYC and inhibition of AKT signaling which mirrored the cell line-specific sensitivities to direct cytotoxicity. At last, the combinatorial approach of the two antibodies resulted in a synergistic survival benefit in a PBMC-humanized Ramos NOD/SCID mouse model.   Conclusions: This study demonstrates that the combination of tafasitamab and rituximab improves efficacy compared to antibody mono treatment in models of aggressive B-cell lymphoma in vitro and in vivo.  Translational Relevance: The immunochemotherapy of rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP) remains the standard of care for newly diagnosed DLBCL patients. However, 30-40% of patients are refractory or relapse after initial response to the immunochemotherapy, indicating a high-unmet medical need for these patients.

In the context of acute myocardial infarction (AMI), evidence of specific systemic mechanisms characterizing AVSc are currently lacking.  Objective: To evaluate the systemic pathophysiological landscape that might differentiate AVSc from non-AVSc subjects in AMI.  Methods: Whole-blood transcriptome of AVSc (n=44) and no-AVSc (n=66) patients with AMI was assessed by RNA-sequencing. A bioinformatic workflow, including feature selection, differential expression and enrichment analysis was performed to identify gene expression signatures discriminating AVSc from no-AVSc and infer functional association.

myocardial infarction,GSE165543,37491334,Gene Expression by RNA-Seq of Peripheral Blood Monocyte with the EZH2 inhibitor GSK-343,"Epigenetic regulation of histone H3K27 methylation has recently emerged as a key step during alternative M2-like macrophage (M2) polarization, essential for cardiac repair after Myocardial Infarction (MI). We hypothesized that EZH2, responsible for H3K27 methylation, could act as an epigenetic checkpoint regulator during this process. We demonstrate for the first time inactivation of EZH2 activity, linked to ectopic cytoplasmic localization of the epigenetic enzyme, during monocyte differentiation in vitro as well as in M2 macrophages in vivo during post-MI cardiac inflammation.

Epigenetic regulation of histone H3K27 methylation has recently emerged as a key step during alternative M2-like macrophage (M2) polarization, essential for cardiac repair after Myocardial Infarction (MI). We hypothesized that EZH2, responsible for H3K27 methylation, could act as an epigenetic checkpoint regulator during this process.

myocardial infarction,GSE205405,36250966,Metabolic labeling of cardiomyocyte-derived small extracellular-vesicle (sEV) miRNAs identifies miR-208a in cardiac regulation of lung gene expression,"Toxoplasma gondii uracil phosphoribosyltransferase (UPRT) converts 4-thiouracil (4TUc) into 4-thiouridine (4TUd), which is incorporated into nascent RNAs and can be biotinylated, then labeled with streptavidin conjugates or isolated via streptavidin-affinity methods. Here, we generated mice that expressed T. gondii UPRT only in cardiomyocytes (CMUPRT mice) and tested our hypothesis that CM-derived miRNAs (CMmiRs) are transferred into remote organs after myocardial infarction (MI) by small extracellular vesicles (sEV) that are released from the heart into the peripheral blood (PBsEV). We found that 4TUd was incorporated with high specificity and sensitivity into RNAs isolated from the hearts and PBsEV of CMUPRT mice six hours after 4TUc injection. In PBsEV, 4TUd was incorporated into CM-specific/enriched miRs including miR-208a, but not into miRs with other organ or tissue-type specificities. 4TUd-labeled miR208a was also present in lung tissues, especially lung endothelial cells (ECs), and CM-derived miR-208a (CMmiR-208a) levels peaked 12 hours after experimentally induced MI in PBsEV and 24 hours after MI in the lung. Notably, miR-208a is expressed from intron 29 of alpha myosin heavy chain (a-MHC), but a-MHC transcripts were nearly undetectable in the lung. When PBsEV from mice that underwent MI (MI-PBsEV) or sham surgery (Sham-PBsEV) were injected into intact mice, the expression of Tmbim6 and NLK, which are suppressed by miR-208a and cooperatively regulate inflammation via the NF-kappa B pathway, was lower in the lungs of MI-PBsEV-treated animals than the lungs of animals treated with Sham-PBsEV or saline. In MI mice, Tmbim6 and NLK were downregulated, whereas endothelial adhesion molecules and pro-inflammatory cells were upregulated in the lung; these changes were significantly attenuated when the mice were treated with miR-208a antagomirs prior to MI surgery. Thus, CMUPRT mice enables us to track sEV-mediated transport of CMmiRs and identify an miR-208a-mediated mechanism by which myocardial injury alters the expression of genes and inflammatory response in the lung.","two troup : 1, small extracellular vesicle from peripherial blood 12 h after sham surgery, 2,   small extracellular vesicle from peripherial blood 12 h after myocardial infarction surgery.

They are involved in regulation at the posttranscriptional and translational levels through the degradation and translation inhibition of messenger RNA (mRNA). It is estimated that at least 60% of all mammalian genes may be regulated by miRNAs. MiRNAs can help uncover the mechanisms of diseases and provide new entry points into therapy. Accumulated evidence has revealed that miRNAs are involved in the pathological process of cardiovascular disease through specific signaling pathways. To investigate the potential miRNAs for myocardial fibrosis post myocardial infarction, rat models of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) were established by ligating the anterior descending branch of the left coronary artery, while sham-operated rats were only threaded without ligation as a control group. There were three rats in each group. Thirteen differentially expressed miRNAs between the two groups were screened and their expression levels in the model group were all higher than those in the control group. The expression of miR-199a-5p was significantly increased in the model group in qRT-PCR, which was consistent with the results of the gene chip. KEGG enrichment analysis showed that the target genes of miR-199a-5p were enriched in the insulin signaling pathway. Furthermore, dual-luciferase reporter assay indicated that miR-199a-5p could negatively regulate the expression of GSK-3β. After transfection, the expression of miR-199a-5p was increased in the miR-199a-5p mimics group. The protein expression of GSK-3β was decreased in CFs transfected with miR-199a-5p mimics. In summary, our study identified miR-199a-5p could promote the progression of myocardial fibrosis after myocardial infarction by targeting GSK-3β, which provides novel targets for diagnosis and treatment of MF.

In summary, our study identified miR-199a-5p could promote the progression of myocardial fibrosis after myocardial infarction by targeting GSK-3β, which provides novel targets for diagnosis and treatment of MF. In summary, our research suggests that miR-199a-5p promotes the progression of myocardial fibrosis after myocardial infarction through the activation of the insulin-PI3K/Akt-GSK-3β signaling pathway.. SPF male Sprague–Dawley (SD) rats weighing 200±20 g were purchased from Beijing Vital River Laboratory Animal Technology Co. Ltd. Raised in the Barrier Animal Laboratory of Dongzhimen Hospital, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, with a 12 h light/dark cycle and ad libitum food and water. All protocols and applications of animals in this study were approved by The Animal Care and Welfare Committee of Dongzhimen Hospital, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine (No: 16-25). The rats were divided into model group and sham-operated group by random number table. Before surgery, the rat was anesthetized intraperitoneally with 1% sodium pentobarbital (40 mg/kg). The skin was cut laterally at the third and fourth ribs of the left chest, approximately 1.5 cm in length. The musculature was bluntly separated, the rib was braced with a thoracotomy and the thymus was fixed upward to fully enlarge the surgical field, and the pericardium was carefully torn open to expose the ligation site of the rat heart. The anterior descending branch of the left coronary artery was ligated with a 5/0 line approximately 2 mm below the left atrial appendage and the arterial cone. The anterior myocardial wall was quickly ischemic and whitening, and the electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed saddle-back-like ST-segment elevations. After 24 h, the ECG was conducted again, and pathological Q waves appeared in the chest leads and lead I and aVL, indicating that the model was successful. The sham-operated rats were only threaded without ligation as a control group. The rats were fed adequate food and deionized water for 4 successive weeks, subsequently euthanized and dissected to isolate the heart for the subsequent experiments. Left ventricular samples were obtained for RNA extraction and hybridization on Agilent miRNA Microarrays.. Non-coding RNA profiling by array.

Pharmacological inhibition of mammalian STE20-like protein kinase 1/2 (MST1/2) with XMU-MP-1 might augment tissue regeneration and repair by suppressing apoptosis and increasing cell proliferation. However, MST1 has anti-inflammatory activity, inhibition of which may result in therapy failure. Here, we identified an approach with the potential to overcome this limitation by protecting against cardiac inflammation resulting from inhibition of MST1 in macrophages. We found exacerbation of cardiac dysfunction in LysMCre-mediated Mst1/2-deficient mice after myocardial infarction (MI). This effect was attributed to a shift of macrophage subtypes from those expressing Cxcl2 and Cd163 toward those with Ccl2 and Ccl4 expression. Mass spectrometry identified leukotriene B4 (LTB4) as the lipid mediator that was upregulated in the absence of MST1. We found that MST1 phosphorylated 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) at its T218 residue, disrupting the interaction between 5-LOX and 5-LOX-activating protein, and resulting in reduction of LTB4 production. By contrast, a 5-LOXT218A variant showed no response to MST1. Moreover, treatment of peritoneal macrophages with LTB4 or with medium conditioned by Mst1-deficient macrophages resulted in high Ccl2 and Ccl4 expression and low Cxcl2 and Cd163 expression, except when the cells were co-treated with the LTB4 receptor 1 (BLT1) antagonist CP105696. Furthermore, CP105696 ameliorated cardiac dysfunction in LysMCre-mediated Mst1/2-deficient mice and enhanced cardiac repair in wild-type mice treated with XMU-MP-1 after MI.

This effect was attributed to a shift of macrophage subtypes from those expressing Cxcl2 and Cd163 toward those with Ccl2 and Ccl4 expression. Mass spectrometry identified leukotriene B4 (LTB4) as the lipid mediator that was upregulated in the absence of MST1. We found that MST1 phosphorylated 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) at its T218 residue, disrupting the interaction between 5-LOX and 5-LOX-activating protein, and resulting in reduction of LTB4 production. By contrast, a 5-LOXT218A variant showed no response to MST1. Moreover, treatment of peritoneal macrophages with LTB4 or with medium conditioned by Mst1-deficient macrophages resulted in high Ccl2 and Ccl4 expression and low Cxcl2 and Cd163 expression, except when the cells were co-treated with the LTB4 receptor 1 (BLT1) antagonist CP105696. Furthermore, CP105696 ameliorated cardiac dysfunction in LysMCre-mediated Mst1/2-deficient mice and enhanced cardiac repair in wild-type mice treated with XMU-MP-1 after MI. The combination of an MST1/2 inhibitor and a BLT1 antagonist represents a promising strategy for combatting the effects of MI.. Single cell RNA-Seq of mouse hearts.

renin,GSE37825,22918120,Adrenal gene expression profiles of male and female Kcnk3 null mice in basal conditions or after hormonal treatment.,"Primary aldosteronism (PA) is a common form of endocrine hypertension suspected in the presence of arterial hypertension (HT), hypokalemia and low plasma renin levels. While for a long time the genetic causes of PA have remained mysterious, recent findings have revealed an important role for an altered function of potassium channels in the pathogenesis of this disease. The basis for the unique sensitivity of adrenal zona glomerulosa (ZG) cells for plasma potassium concentration is a very high background potassium conductance, which is dependent on expression at high levels of two 2-pore domain (K2P) potassium channels, Task1 (KCNK3) and Task3 (KCNK9. Recent studies have shown that mice lacking Kcnk3 (Task1) or both Kcnk3 and Kcnk9 have PA. In Kcnk3 null mice, hyperaldosteronism is present in young animals of either sex, but is corrected in males after puberty. Strikingly, in these animals hyperaldosteronism associates with abnormal adrenal cortex functional zonation, since Cyp11b2, the rate-limiting enzyme for aldosterone production, is expressed in the inner region of the adrenal cortex and not in the glomerulosa. Additionally, this phenotype is under the control of sex hormones, as shown by the fact that castration of male Kcnk3 -/- animals prevents normal Cyp11b2 distribution, while testosterone injection in female Kcnk3 null mice restores expression of Cyp11b2 in ZG cells. We took advantage of the unique characteristics of the Kcnk3 null mouse model to search for genes that can modify their phenotype of PA and adrenocortical functional zonation. Using gene expression profiling in the adrenal glands of Kcnk3 null mice and exploiting the possibility of modulation of their phenotype by sexual hormones, we identified a cluster of genes closely associated with hyperaldosteronism in a sex- and hormone-dependent dynamic fashion. Among these genes, we focused our attention on Dkk3 (dickkopf3), encoding a peculiar member of the dickkopf family of Wnt signalling modulators because of its close association with aldosterone-producing cells in humans (11). Inactivation of Dkk3 in the Kcnk3 null background causes extension of the hyperaldosteronemic phenotype and increased expression of Cyp11b2 in the adrenal gland to the male sex, without affecting functional zonation. These data indicate that Dkk3 is a component of the genetic circuitry regulating expression of Cyp11b2 and suggest that it may be implicated in the pathogenesis of low-renin hyperaldosteronism in humans.","One color -experiment with 2 strains of mice: C57BL/6 WT or Kcnk3 null (KO): male and female in basal conditions or following hormonal treatment (castration for males and testosterone injection for females), corresponding to 8 groups of animals.

The presence of renin and angiotensinogen has been reported in the rostral ventrolateral nucleus (RVLM). Overactivation of bulbospinal neurons RVLM is linked to hypertension (HTN). Previous studies have shown that the brain RAS plays a role in the pathogenesis of the deoxycorticosterone (DOCA)-salt HTN model. Thus, we hypothesized that PRR in the RVLM is involved in the local activation of the RAS, facilitating the development of DOCA-salt HTN. Selective PRR ablation targeting the RVLM (PRRRVLM-Null mice) resulted in an unexpected sex-dependent and biphasic phenotype in DOCA-salt HTN. That is, PRRRVLM-Null females (but not males) exhibited a significant delay in achieving maximal pressor responses during the initial stage of DOCA-salt HTN. Female PRRRVLM-Null subsequently showed exacerbated DOCA-salt-induced pressor responses during the “maintenance” phase with a maximal peak at 13 days on DOCA-salt. This exacerbated response was associated with an increased sympathetic drive to the resistance arterioles and the kidney, exacerbated fluid and sodium intake and output in response to DOCA-salt, and induced mobilization of fluids from the intracellular to extracellular space concomitant with elevated vasopressin. Ablation of PRR suppressed genes involved in RAS activation and catecholamine synthesis in the RVLM but also induced expression of genes involved in inflammatory responses.

Sparsentan significantly delayed onset of glomerulosclerosis, interstitial fibrosis, proteinuria, and glomerular filtration rate decline. Sparsentan attenuated glomerular basement membrane defects, blunted mesangial filopodial invasion into the glomerular capillaries, increased lifespan more than losartan, and lessened changes in profibrotic/proinflammatory genes pathways in both the glomerular and renal cortical compartments. Notably, treatment with sparsentan, but not losartan, prevented accumulation of extracellular matrix in the strial capillary basement membranes in the inner ear and reduced susceptibility to hearing loss. Improvements in lifespan and in renal and strial pathology were observed even when sparsentan was initiated after development of renal pathologies.

However, they are mostly centered on mRNAs and proteins. The effect of the virus on human post-transcriptional regulatory agents such as microRNAs (miRNAs) involved in the regulation of 60% of human gene activity remains poorly explored. Similar to what we have previously done with other viruses such as Ebola and HIV, in this study we investigated the miRNA profile of lung epithelial cells following infection with SARS-CoV-2. At the 24 and 72 hours post-infection, SARS-CoV-2 did not drastically alter the miRNome. About 90% of the miRNAs remained non-differentially expressed. The results revealed that miR-1246, miR-1290 and miR-4728-5p were the most upregulated over time. miR-196b-5p and miR-196a-5p were the most downregulated at 24 h while at 72 h, miR-3924, miR-30e-5p and miR-145-3p showed the highest level of downregulation.

However, in current clinical practice, the strategy for targeting the RAAS is not sufficient to reverse hypertrophy. Here, we investigated the effect of prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) on angiotensin II (AngII)-induced cardiac hypertrophy and potential molecular mechanisms underlying the effect.   Methods and Results: Adult male C57 mice were continuously infused with AngII or saline and treated daily with PGE1 or vehicle for two weeks. Neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were cultured to detect AngII-induced hypertrophic responses. We found that PGE1 ameliorated AngII-induced cardiac hypertrophy both in vivo and in vitro. The RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and expression pattern analysis results suggest that Netrin-1 (Ntn1) is the specific target gene of PGE1. The protective effect of PGE1 was eliminated after knockdown of Ntn1. Moreover, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis showed that the PGE1-mediated signaling pathway changes are associated with the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. PGE1 suppressed AngII-induced activation of the MAPK signaling pathway, and such an effect was attenuated by Ntn1 knockdown. Blockade of MAPK signaling rescued the phenotype of cardiomyocytes caused by Ntn1 knockdown, indicating that MAPK signaling may act as the downstream effector of Ntn1. Furthermore, inhibition of the E-prostanoid (EP)3 receptor, as opposed to the EP1, EP2, or EP4 receptor, in cardiomyocytes reversed the effect of PGE1, and activation of EP3 by sulprostone, a specific agonist, mimicked the effect of PGE1.  Conclusion: In conclusion, PGE1 ameliorates AngII-induced cardiac hypertrophy through activation of the EP3 receptor and upregulation of Ntn1, which inhibits the downstream MAPK signaling pathway. Thus, targeting EP3, as well as the Ntn1–MAPK axis, may represent a novel approach for treating pathological cardiac hypertrophy.","Cardiac mRNA profiles of C57 mice treated with saline, AngII and AngII + PGE1",Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,"Xia,,Wang, Xin,,Pan, Xiaoxiao,,Yang, Jiali,,Cai","drug effects, genetics, Netrin-1, Mice, Inbred C57BL, Male, Angiotensin II, Rats, Sprague-Dawley, Receptors, Prostaglandin E, EP3 Subtype, Signal Transduction, chemically induced, Mice, pharmacology, Cardiomegaly, Rats, Animals, Myocytes, Cardiac, Up-Regulation, Alprostadil","Prostaglandin E1 attenuates AngII-induced cardiac hypertrophy via EP3 receptor activation and Netrin-1upregulation.

One of the most important signaling pathways associated with the regulation of blood pressure is the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), with its main mediator angiotensin II (ANGII).

Differential gene expression was assessed in three groups: malignant hypertension (MH), non-malignant hypertension (NMH) and normotensive, sham operated controls (sham). To distinguish MH from NMH, we considered two factors: weight loss and typical renovascular lesions. Mean blood pressure measured intraarterially was elevated to a similar degree in MH (220.0±6.5 mmHg) and NMH (192.0±6.4 mmHg) compared to controls (119.5±1.7 mmHg, p<0.05). 886 genes were exclusively regulated in MH only.

The data suggest that these pathways may contribute to the most severe forms of hypertensive nephrosclerosis..

renin-angiotensin system,GSE149006,34340197,Transcriptomic analysis of Resp18mutant rat kidneys reveals up-regulation of Renin-Angiotensin system,"Regulated endocrine specific protein 18 (Resp18), expression has been specifically located in a series of tissues and cell types however the exact cellular function is unknown. In previous studies we have showed that a targeted disruption of Resp18 in Dahl SS rats (Resp18mutant) resulted in higher blood pressure (BP), increased renal fibrosis, and decreased survival rate on a long term (6-week) 2% high salt (HS) diet treatment compared with wild type SS rats. In the current study we studied whether a short term (1 week) exposure to HS diet shows a similar effect in Resp18mutant rats. Furthermore, previously we have shown that in addition to BP phenotype Resp18mutant rats have demonstrated deteriorative kidney phenotype evident through renal fibrosis, protein urea and protein cast formation. Based on this background we conducted BP study and performed transcriptomic profiling of the kidney after one-week exposure to HS diet treatment. Through radio-telemetry procedure, we found that the systolic BP was increased in the Resp18mutant rats compared with SS rats even with short term HS diet exposure. Therefore, we sought out to investigate if there was any alteration in the transcriptomic response by HS diet treatment in the Resp18mutant rat kidneys. Using RNA sequencing approach, we found that Resp18mutant rats showed a differential expression of 25 genes of which one was an upregulation of Ren. We confirmed the upregulation of Ren and other differentially expressed genes via qRT-PCR analysis. Upon KEGG pathway enrichment we found that the Resp18mutant rat showed upregulation in the renin angiotensin system (RAAS), and renin secretion pathway. Furthermore, the renin activity is found to be higher in Resp18mutant rats serum compared with SS rats.

renin-angiotensin system,GSE19366,21865292,Genomic-Derived Markers for Early Detection of Calcineurin Inhibitor Immunosuppressant–Mediated Nephrotoxicity,"The use of calcineurin inhibitor (CI) immunosuppressants has significantly improved the early allograft survival rate in organ transplantation. However, CI therapy has been associated with chronic nephrotoxicity, which limits their long-term utility. In order to understand the mechanisms of the toxicity, we analyzed the gene expression changes that underlie the development of CI immunosuppressant-mediated nephrotoxicity, in male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats dosed daily with cyclosporine (CsA), FK506 or rapamycin (Rapa) for 1 to 28 days. We identified a group of genes, whose expression in rat kidney is quantitatively correlated with CI-induced kidney injury as observed in changes in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels and kidney histopathology. These genes include both up-regulated genes, such as Ren1 and Klks3, and down-regulated genes, such as Calb1, Egf, NCC, and kidney specific Wnk1 (KS-Wnk1). Using the down-regulated genes alone we successfully predicted CI immunosuppressant-mediated kidney injury in rats following 7 days of treatment. Among these genes are two mechanism-related genes, NCC and KS-Wnk1, both of which are involved in the sodium transport in the distal nephrons. The down-regulation of both genes at the mRNA and protein level in rat kidney following CI treatment was confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR and immunohistochemical staining, respectively. We hypothesize that decreased expression of NCC may cause reduced sodium chloride reabsorption in the distal tubules, and contribute to the prolonged activation of the Renin-Angiotensin-System (RAS), a demonstrated contributor to the development of CI-induced nephrotoxicity in both animal models and clinical settings. Therefore, NCC and KS-Wnk1 could potentially be used as biomarkers for early detection and prevention of CI-related nephrotoxicity in clinical practice.","Male SD rats approximately 5-7 weeks old were maintained on certified rodent chow and dosed i.p. with olive oil, CsA (CAS # 59865-13-3, 2.5 or 25 mg/kg/day), FK506 (CAS # 104987-11-3, 0.6 or 6 mg/kg/day), or Rapa (CAS # 53123-88-9, 1 or 10 mg/kg/day) (LC Laboratories, Woburn, MA) for 1, 7, 14 or 28 consecutive days.

Genetic factors, including single nucleotide polymorphisms and sex, are increasingly recognized as potential risk factors for the development of cardiovascular disease. Double transgenic rats (dTGR), harboring human renin and angiotensinogen genes, were used in this study to investigate potential sex differences influencing renal function and renal gene expression. dTGR males and females had comparable increases in blood pressure, whereas body weight, albuminuria/proteinuria and urine flow rate were higher in males. At eight weeks of age renal plasma flow and glomerular filtration rate were proportionally lower in males, and renal vascular resistance tended to be higher. Males developed more severe tubulointerstitial and vascular lesions. By the end of week eight, 40% of the males, but none of the females had died. Genome expression studies were performed with RNA from kidneys of 7-week-old male and female dTGR and control rats to further investigate the sex-related differences on a molecular level. Forty-five genes showed sex-dependent expression patterns in dTGR that were significantly different compared to controls. Cathepsin L, one of the genes differentially expressed between the sexes, was shown to be also strongly associated with the degree of renal injury. In dTGR, urinary CTSL at week 7 was higher in males (ng/24 hours: M 512 +/- 163, F 132 +/- 70).
