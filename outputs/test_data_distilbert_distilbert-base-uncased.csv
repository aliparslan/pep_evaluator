0,adrenal cortex,gse205272,37129912,"β-catenin programs a tissue-specific epigenetic vulnerability in aggressive adrenocortical carcinoma (dna methylation array). adrenocortical carcinoma (acc) is a rare cancer in which tissue-specific differentiation is paradoxically associated with dismal outcomes. the differentiated acc subtype cimp-high is prevalent, incurable, and routinely fatal. cimp-high acc possess abnormal dna methylation and frequent β-catenin activating mutations. here, we demonstrate that this differentiated state is maintained by a balance between nuclear, tissue-specific β-catenin-containing complexes and the acc epigenome. on chromatin, β-catenin binds master adrenal transcription factor sf1 and hijacks the adrenocortical super-enhancer landscape to maintain differentiation. off chromatin, β-catenin binds histone methyltransferase ezh2, which is redistributed by the cimp-high dna methylation signature. sf1/β-catenin and ezh2/β-catenin complexes exist in normal adrenals and are selected for through all phases of acc evolution. ezh2 inhibition in cimp-high acc favors ezh2/β-catenin assembly and purges sf1/β-catenin from chromatin, erasing differentiation and restraining cancer growth in vitro and in vivo. our studies illustrate how tissue-specific programs shape oncogene selection, surreptitiously encoding targetable therapeutic vulnerabilities.. human acc cell line nci-h295r was treated with vehicle dmso (baseline) or ezh2 inhibitor epz-6438 (ezh2i) to evaluate the impact of ezh2 inhibition on the acc epigenome. at endpoint, cells were harvested for dna methylation array profiling by illumina epic array. alternatively, human adrenal glands were microdissected for zona fasciculata (zf), zona reticularis (zr), or fetal zone (fz). after microdissection, dna was extracted and submitted for methylation profiling by illumina epic array. donors for zf and zr samples are identified by number at the end of title (e.g. donor 1 provided zf1 and zr1, donor 3 provided zf3 and zr3 and so on). fetal zone samples came from independent donors.. methylation profiling by array. dipika,r,mohan, juilee,,rege, william,e,rainey, gary,d,hammer, antonio,m,lerario","['genetics', 'beta Catenin', 'Adrenocortical Carcinoma', 'metabolism', 'Adrenal Cortex Neoplasms', 'Chromatin', 'Humans', 'pathology', 'Epigenesis', 'Genetic']","('Animals', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'genetics', 'metabolism')"

5,adrenal cortex,gse179308,35603952,"identification of new tcf21 targets in adrenocortical carcinoma cells. transcription factor 21 (tcf21) directly binds and regulates sf1 in tumor and normal adrenocortical cells, and both are involved in the development and steroidogenesis of the adrenal cortex. tcf21 is a tumor suppressor gene and its expression is reduced in malignant tumors. in adrenocortical tumors, it is less expressed in adrenocortical carcinomas (acc) than in adrenocortical adenomas (aca) and normal tissue. however, a comprehensive analysis to identify tcf21 targets have not yet been conducted in any type of cancer. in this study, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing (chip-seq) in adrenocortical carcinoma cell line (nci-h295r) overexpressing tcf21, with the aim of identifying tcf21 new targets. the five most frequently identified sequences corresponded to the prdm7, cntnap2, cacna1b, ptprn2 and kcne1b genes. validation experiments showed that, in nci-h295r cells, tcf21 regulates gene expression positively in prdm7 and negatively in cacna1b. recently, it was observed that the n-type calcium channel v2.2 (cav2.2) encoded by cacna1b gene is important in angiotensin ii signal transduction for corticosteroid biosynthesis in nci-h295r adrenocortical carcinoma cells. indeed, tcf21 inhibits cacna1b and cav2.2 expression in nci-h295r. in addition, in a cohort of 55 adult patients with adrenocortical tumor, cacna1b expression was higher in acc than aca, and was related to poor disease-free survival in acc patients. these results suggest a mechanism of steroidogenesis control by tcf21 in adrenocortical tumor cells, in addition to the control observed through sf1 inhibition. importantly, steroid production could impair tumor immunogenicity, contributing to the immune resistance described in adrenal cancer.. fragmented dna without immunoprecipitation was used as a positive control, and two replicates of nci-h295r pcmvmycpod1 cells were sequenced. reads were mapped using grch38 homo sapiens (human) genome assembly. the phred quality score (q>30) of the bases was verified, low-quality and duplicate readings were removed, and peak calling was performed using macs2 (v2.1.1) (p<0.01) wrapped in aquas chip-seq pipeline (https://github.com/nhlbi-bcb/tf_chipseq_pipeline, accessed on 22/nov/2020) (zhang et al., 2008). the idr <0.05 (irreproducible discovery rate) was calculated to identify consistent peaks, which guarantees the reproducibility of the experiment (li et al., 2011). all readings considered as noise by the blacklist of the encyclopedia of dna elements (encode) were excluded (amemiya et al., 2019).. genome binding/occupancy profiling by high throughput sequencing. barbara,s,passaia, jean,l,kremer, maria,c,fragoso, claudimara,f,lotfi","['Cell Line', 'Tumor', 'Calcium Channels', 'N-Type', 'genetics', 'Adrenocortical Carcinoma', 'metabolism', 'Adrenal Cortex Neoplasms', 'Signal Transduction', 'Humans', 'Adult', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors']","('Animals', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'genetics', 'metabolism', 'pathology')"
6,adrenal cortex,gse143385,33148256,"microrna expression analysis of metastatic adrenocortical tumors. background: adrenocortical carcinoma (acc) is a rare, often-aggressive neoplasm of the adrenal cortex, with a 14.5-month median overall survival. we asked whether tumors from patients with advanced or metastatic acc would offer clues as to putative genes that might have critical roles in disease progression or in more aggressive disease biology.   methods: we conducted comprehensive genomic and expression analyses, including microrna profiling, of 33 accs and 6 normal adrenals.  results: copy number gains and losses matched that previously reported. we identified a median mutation rate of 3.38 per megabase (mb), somewhat higher than in a previous study possibly related to the more advanced disease. the mutational signature was characterized by a predominance of c>t, c>a and t>c transitions. as in previously reports, only cancer genes tp53 (26%) and beta-catenin (ctnnb1, 14%) were mutated in more than 10% of samples. the tcga-identified putative cancer genes men1 and prkar1a were found in low frequency – 4.7% and 2.3%, respectively. most of the mutations were in genes not implicated in the etiology or maintenance of cancer. specifically, amongst the 38 genes that were mutated in more than 9% of samples, only four were represented in tier 1 of the 576 cosmic cancer gene census (ccgc). thus, 82% of genes found to have mutations likely have no role in the etiology or biology of acc; while the role of the other 18%, if any, remains to be proven. finally, the transcript length for the 38 most frequently mutated genes in acc is statistically longer than the average of all coding genes, raising the question of whether transcript length in part determined mutation probability.   conclusions: we conclude that the mutational and expression profiles of advanced and metastatic tumors is very similar to those from newly diagnosed patients –with very little in the way of genomic aberration to explain it. our data and that in the previous analyses finds the rate of mutations in accs lower than that in other cancers and suggests an epigenetic basis for the disease should be the focus of future studies.. tumor samples embedded in oct were sectioned, stained with hematoxylin and eosin and reviewed by a pathologist. rna was extracted from 50-100 mg of tumor using the qiagen mirneasy kit and then used for microrna pofiling. author states 'i have no raw data'.  thus, this submissionis incomplete.. non-coding rna profiling by array. thomas,,litman, susan,e,bates, antonio,t,fojo","['Disease Progression', 'Adrenocortical Carcinoma', 'Humans', 'Adult', 'Female', 'biosynthesis', 'RNA', 'Neoplasm', 'Young Adult', 'genetics', 'Adrenal Cortex Neoplasms', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Neoplasm Proteins', 'DNA Copy Number Variations', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neoplasm Recurrence', 'Local', 'RNA', 'Messenger', 'Aged', 'Middle Aged', 'pathology', 'MicroRNAs', 'Tissue Array Analysis', 'Exome Sequencing', 'Transcriptome', 'epidemiology', 'Male', 'Mutation', 'Exome']","('Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'RNA', 'genetics', 'metabolism', 'pathology')"
